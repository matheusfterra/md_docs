Vapi is a voice AI platform that facilitates conversations with voicebots. To enable our service, we process and store certain information related to the calls, assistants, credentials and phone numbers as outlined below. We act as a data processor on behalf of our customers.

If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a Client, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Client to these Terms, and any reference to "you" and "your" will refer and apply to that party. If you do not agree to all of these Terms, you shall not use the Service and you should not set up an Account (as defined).
By agreeing to these Terms, you expressly agree that except for limited circumstances, the parties will only resolve disputes by arbitration, solely on an individual basis.
## 1. Acceptance of these Terms
You hereby agree to accept these Terms by opening an account under a username, notwithstanding any existing services agreement to which you may also be signatory which incorporated these Terms by reference.
You also agree to abide by other VAPI rules and policies, including our [Privacy Policy](https://code.vapi.ai/privacy) (which explains what information we collect from you and how we protect it) that are expressly incorporated into and are a part of these Terms. Please read them carefully.
Once you accept these Terms you are bound by them until they are terminated. See Section 7 (Term and Termination).
## 2. Using the Services
a. Right to Use and License. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, VAPI hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and revocable (i) right to use the Services and (ii) where applicable in cases of on premise installations, license to object code that is installed in your Systems (where "Systems" means computing machine running code, whether on your premise or on a 3rd party's cloud platform), solely for the purposes of utilizing the Service to deploy AI voice agents and solely in the manner described in these Terms and in any technical documentation contained in, or provided with, the Services.
You acknowledge and agree that you are only being granted a right to use the Services and nothing is being sold to you. You do not acquire any ownership interest in the Services under these Terms, or any other rights thereto, other than to use the Service in accordance with the use rights specified and other terms, conditions, and restrictions of these Terms. We reserve all other rights that are not granted in these Terms.
See Section 4 for more details on your use and Intellectual Property Rights (as defined) under these Terms.
b. What We Provide. The Services include but are not limited to a hosted software solution (**"Platform"**) that allows you to create voice agents that can interact with your customers and stakeholders and respond to queries by such individuals in the most realistic manner possible.
Our Platform (think of it as an orchestration layer over three modules that are provided by various suppliers as well as a collection of tools, including a web dashboard (**"Dashboard"**)), that allows you to, either via our API or via the Dashboard, utilize a **transcribing service module** and intake or record stakeholder speech (usually on your device), followed by the transcription of the speech to text (either on your device or in a cloud server), and then the **processing of the text on a trained large language model** (**"LLM"** or **"AI Model"**) to generate responses, and then the **conversion of text to speech** to be delivered to the stakeholder (using the voice module) (the Platform and additional value adds, such as phone numbers that connect to our Platform, but excluding Providers' offering, collectively, the **"Services"**).
Our Platform stitches together the various modules' individual steps to provide a smooth and responsive conversation, which is notable not only for being latency-optimized, but also for being realistic, as our custom models create a conversational experience that feels human, utilizing tools with respect to managing endpointing, interruptions, filtering of background noise and voice, and more. For more details see [**How Vapi Works**](https://docs.vapi.ai/how-vapi-works) on our website.
c. Third-Parties. Our control layer interacts with our third-party service providers (our **"Providers"**) as part of Services or parties that you wish to utilize. We expect our Providers list to grow with time. You understand and agree that when you use the various aspects of the Services (i.e. the transcription (i.e. through providers such as Deepgram), the LLM processing (we support any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including Azure OpenAI, or your own custom LLM) and our voice generation (all voice providers are supported)), we will be sharing Your Content (as defined) with each Provider, subject to each Provider's individual terms and conditions. We do not make any representation and warranties on any Provider's behalf, nor are we an agent of any such Provider. We principally provide you a control layer to obtain the best experience possible for AI-enabled voice agents using each such Provider's capabilities.
Our Services are very flexible and our Platform allows you to conveniently customize which third parties you would like to use as part of the Services (whether our Providers or your own, including your own AI Models). If you have existing accounts with any of our Providers, you can bring your own API keys to Vapi. You can add them in the Dashboard under the Provider Keys tab. Once your API key is validated, you won't be charged when using that provider through Vapi. Instead, you'll be charged directly by the provider. The fees we charge you bundles in the usage fee from each of our Providers on a per use basis and our fee will be modified accordingly. Enterprise customers shall be subject to custom pricing schemes. For more details on customization and other details on our Service, check out our collection of [**Documents**](https://docs.vapi.ai/introduction) which will assist you in leveraging our Services efficiently.
You will in certain instances, need to have separate subscriptions with our Providers. For instance, if you would like to utilize the benefits of certain voice generation module providers (i.e. ElevenLabs or PlayHT) you will need to subscribe to an API plan that suits your needs with the respective Provider, as further described in out documentation on our website.
d. Use Restrictions. You agree to not, directly or indirectly (and will not permit any third party) to:

  1. You hereby grant VAPI a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, analyze, transmit, and distribute (**"Handle"**) Your Content during the Term. This license to Handle is solely for the purpose of us and our Providers providing you the Services.  
The specific information you permit us to Handle is determined by customizable settings that are in your control.  
Our API has a "hipaaEnabled" option, that limits VAPI's use of data if set to the "True" setting. If set to "True", data persistence (which refers to the ability of data to survive after the call is made to the Platform is completed) is disabled, VAPI would only has access to data inserted into the Platform via the Dashboard / API until deleted as per retention policy or manually by you and no call logs, recordings, or transcriptions are stored by us during or after your call. No information may be utilized for training our AI model.  
Alternatively, if "hipaaEnabled" option set to "False", call data persistence is enabled, and we would have access to all audio data, transcripts, and data injected into the Platform via the Dashboard / API until deleted as per retention policy or manually by you. In this case, you grant us a right to use persisted call data on model training for either VAPI proprietary model or on-premise hosted models for call improvement features, including but not limited to end-of-turn and interruption detection.  
We do not utilize Your Content to obtain any customer specific intelligence. Our scope of use of data in all instances is only for purposes of enhancing call features, latency and the performance of your AI voice agents, and does not in any way relate to capturing and using personal information of any caller or any information/inputs of a caller in respect of your business or the caller.
  2. You agree that submission of any ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals to VAPI (**"Feedback"**) is at your own risk and that VAPI has no obligations (including without limitation obligations of confidentiality) with respect to such Feedback. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit the Feedback. You hereby grant to VAPI a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, perform, display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all Feedback for any purpose.

b. Arbitration. You and VAPI agree that any controversy, allegation, or claim that arises out of or relates to the Service, these Terms, or any additional terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, a **"Dispute"**) arising out of will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except for: (1) any controversy, allegation, or claim that arises out of or relates to our actual or alleged intellectual property rights; (2) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; (3) any claim for equitable relief.

What did we demo? A real-time, natural voice AI, powered by the Groq LPU Inference Engine over 12,000km and 12 timezones away. You know you've set new expectations when most of the audience takes out their cellphones and begin recording your demo. The future of AI is here in 2024, thanks to #GroqSpeed 😀  
Also thank you to those who created the software and AI that made it possible: Vapi, Mistral AI, Deepgram, PlayHT, and AI at Meta.

Please note that Indian numbers cannot be obtained from Plivo for use with Vapi. This is due to TRAI regulations, which mandate SIP termination to occur via an Indian server—a requirement we currently do not fulfill.﻿
This guide walks you through setting up both outbound and inbound SIP trunking between Plivo and Vapi.

Vapi lets developers build, test, & deploy voice AI agents in minutes rather than months — solving for the foundational challenges voice AI applications face:
Simulating the Flow of Natural Human Conversation
Turn-taking, interruption handling, backchanneling, and more.
Realtime/Low Latency Demands
Responsive conversation demands low latency. Internationally. (<500-800ms voice-to-voice).
Taking Actions (Function Calling)
Taking actions during conversation, getting data to your services for custom actions.
Extracting Conversation Data
Review conversation audio, transcripts, & metadata.
Implemented from scratch, this functionality can take months to build, and large, continuous, resources to maintain & improve.
Vapi abstracts away these complexities, allowing developers to focus on the core of their voice AI application’s business logic. **Shipping in days, not months.**

## FAQ
Common questions asked by other users:
###### Is Vapi right for my usecase?
If you are **a developer building a voice AI application simulating human conversation** (w/ LLMs — to whatever degree of application complexity) — Vapi is built for you.
Whether you are building for a completely “turn-based” use case (like appointment setting), all the way to robust agentic voice applications (like virtual assistants), Vapi is tooled to solve for your voice AI workflow.
Vapi runs on any platform: the web, mobile, or even embedded systems (given network access).
###### Sounds good, but I’m building a custom X for Y...
Not a problem, we can likely already support it. Vapi is designed to be modular at every level of the voice pipeline: Text-to-speech, LLM, Speech-to-text.
You can bring your own custom models for any part of the pipeline.
  * **If they’re hosted with one of our providers:** you just need to add your [provider keys](https://docs.vapi.ai/customization/provider-keys), then specify the custom model in your API requests.
  * **If they are hosted elsewhere:** you can use the `Custom LLM` provider and specify the [URL to your model](https://docs.vapi.ai/customization/custom-llm/fine-tuned-openai-models) in your API request.
Everything is interchangeable, mix & match to suit your usecase.
###### Couldn’t I build this myself and save money?
You could (and the person writing this right now did, from scratch) — but there are good reasons for not doing so.
Writing a great realtime voice AI application from scratch is a fairly challenging task (more on those challenges [here](https://docs.vapi.ai/challenges-of-realtime-conversation)). Most of these challenges are not apparent until you face them, then you realize you are 3 weeks into a rabbit hole that may take months to properly solve out of.
Think of Vapi as hiring a software engineering team for this hard problem, while you focus on what uniquely generates value for your voice AI application.
* * *
But to address cost, the vast majority of cost in running your application will come from provider cost (Speect-to-text, LLM, Text-to-speech) direct with vendors (Deepgram, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc) — where we add no fee (vendor cost passes-through). These would have to be incurred anyway.
Vapi only charges its small fee on top of these for the continuous maintenance & improvement of these hardest components of your system (which would have costed you time to write/maintain).
No matter what, some cost is inescapable (in money, time, etc) to solve this challenging technical problem.
Our focus is solely on foundational Voice AI orchestration, & it’s what we put our full time and resources into.
To learn more about Vapi’s pricing, you can visit our [pricing page](https://docs.vapi.ai/pricing).
###### Is it going to be hard to set up?
No — in fact, the setup could not be easier:
  * **Web Dashboard:** It can take minutes to get up & running with our [dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).
  * **Client SDKs:** You can start calls with 1 line of code with any of our [client SDKs](https://docs.vapi.ai/sdks).
For more advanced features like function calling, you will have to set up a [Server URL](https://docs.vapi.ai/server-url) to receive and respond to messages.
###### How is Vapi different from other Voice AI services?
Vapi focuses on developers. Giving developers modular, simple, & robust tooling to build any voice AI application imaginable.
Vapi also has some of the lowest latency & (equally important) highest reliability amongst any other voice AI platform built for developers.
###### Can we achieve latency of around 800 milliseconds?
Yes, Vapi is designed to achieve low latency, typically around 800 milliseconds for end-to-end voice processing. Our infrastructure is optimized for real-time communication, and we continuously work to minimize latency through various optimizations in our pipeline.
###### Do you offer competitive per-minute pricing if we commit to a consistent monthly volume?
Yes, we offer volume-based pricing discounts for customers with consistent monthly usage. The more minutes you commit to, the better the per-minute rate. We’re happy to discuss custom pricing plans based on your specific volume requirements and use case.
###### Can your platform handle high levels of concurrency, ideally between 100 to 500 sessions daily?
Absolutely. Our platform is built to handle high concurrency, and 1000+ concurrent sessions is well within our capacity. We’ve designed our infrastructure to scale horizontally, ensuring reliable performance even during peak usage periods. For enterprise customers with specific scaling needs, we can discuss custom solutions.
###### Are you compliant with HIPAA, SOC 2, and GDPR?
Yes, we take compliance seriously. Vapi is:
  * HIPAA compliant for healthcare applications
  * SOC 2 Type II certified
  * GDPR compliant for handling EU data
  * Regularly audited to maintain these certifications
For detailed compliance documentation and reports, please visit our [security portal](https://security.vapi.ai/).
###### How do you handle PII and PHI securely?
We implement multiple layers of security for PII and PHI:
  * End-to-end encryption for all data in transit
  * Secure storage with encryption at rest
  * Strict access controls and audit logging
  * Regular security assessments and penetration testing
  * Data minimization practices
  * Secure data deletion protocols
All data handling practices are documented in our security policies and compliance frameworks.
###### Do you support white-labeling and on-premise deployments?
Yes, we offer both white-labeling and on-premise deployment options:
  * **White-labeling:** Custom branding, domain, and UI customization

[Website](https://vapi.ai/)[Status](https://status.vapi.ai/)[Support](https://docs.vapi.ai/support)[Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/)
At it’s core, Vapi is an orchestration layer over three modules: the **transcriber** , the **model** , and the **voice**.
![](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://vapi.docs.buildwithfern.com/2025-04-26T20:23:57.489Z/static/images/quickstart/quickstart-banner.png)
These three modules can be swapped out with **any provider** of your choosing; OpenAI, Groq, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, PlayHT, etc. You can even plug in your server to act as the LLM.
Vapi takes these three modules, optimizes the latency, manages the scaling & streaming, and orchestrates the conversation flow to make it sound human.
[1](https://docs.vapi.ai/quickstart#listen-intake-raw-audio)
### Listen (intake raw audio)
When a person speaks, the client device (whether it is a laptop, phone, etc) will record raw audio (1’s & 0’s at the core of it).
This raw audio will have to either be transcribed on the client device itself, or get shipped off to a server somewhere to turn into transcription text.
[2](https://docs.vapi.ai/quickstart#run-an-llm)
### Run an LLM
That transcript text will then get fed into a prompt & run through an LLM ([LLM inference](https://docs.vapi.ai/glossary#inference)). The LLM is the core intelligence that simulates a person behind-the-scenes.
[3](https://docs.vapi.ai/quickstart#speak-text--raw-audio)
### Speak (text → raw audio)
The LLM outputs text that now must be spoken. That text is turned back into raw audio (again, 1’s & 0’s), that is playable back at the user’s device.
This process can also either happen on the user’s device itself, or on a server somewhere (then the raw speech audio be shipped back to the user).
[voice-to-voice](https://docs.vapi.ai/glossary#voice-to-voice) clocks in at <500-700ms.
Vapi pulls all these pieces together, ensuring a smooth & responsive conversation (in addition to providing you with a simple set of tools to manage these inner-workings).

## Introduction to Privacy at Vapi
At Vapi, we are committed to delivering exceptional voice assistant services while upholding the highest standards of privacy and data protection for our users. We understand the importance of balancing service quality with the need to respect and protect personal and sensitive information. Our privacy policies and practices are designed to give you control over your data while benefiting from the full capabilities of our platform.
## Understanding HIPAA Compliance Basics
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a United States legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. HIPAA compliance is crucial for any entity that deals with protected health information (PHI), ensuring that sensitive patient data is handled, stored, and transmitted with the highest standards of security and confidentiality. The key concepts of HIPAA compliance include the Privacy Rule, which protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information; the Security Rule, which sets standards for the security of electronic protected health information (e-PHI); and the Breach Notification Rule, which requires covered entities to notify individuals, HHS, and in some cases, the media of a breach of unsecured PHI. Compliance with these rules is not just about adhering to legal requirements but also about building trust with your customers by demonstrating your commitment to protecting their sensitive data. By enabling the `hipaaEnabled` configuration in Vapi’s voice assistant platform, you are taking a significant step towards aligning your operations with these HIPAA principles, ensuring that your use of technology adheres to these critical privacy and security standards.
## Understanding Default Settings
By default, Vapi records your calls and stores logs and transcriptions. This practice is aimed at continuously improving the quality of our service, ensuring that you receive the best possible experience. However, we recognize the importance of privacy and provide options for users who prefer more control over their data.
## Opting for Privacy: The HIPAA Compliance Option
For users prioritizing privacy, particularly in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Vapi offers the flexibility to opt out of our default data recording settings. Choosing HIPAA compliance through our platform ensures that you can still use our voice assistant services without compromising on privacy requirements.
## Enabling HIPAA Compliance
HIPAA compliance can be ensured by enabling the `hipaaEnabled` configuration in your assistant settings. This simple yet effective setting guarantees that no call logs, recordings, or transcriptions are stored during or after your calls. An end-of-call report message will be generated and stored on your server for record-keeping, ensuring compliance without storing sensitive data on Vapi’s systems.
To enable HIPAA compliance, set hipaaEnabled to true within your assistant’s configuration:
```

1
| {

---|---  

2
|   "hipaaEnabled": true

3
| }

```
Note: The default value for hipaaEnabled is false. Activating this setting is a proactive measure to align with HIPAA standards, requiring manual configuration adjustment.
# FAQs
###### Will enabling HIPAA compliance affect the quality of Vapi's service?
Enabling HIPAA compliance does not degrade the quality of the voice assistant services. However, it limits access to certain features, such as reviewing call logs or transcriptions, that some users may find valuable for quality improvement purposes.
###### Who should use the HIPAA compliance feature?
This feature is particularly useful for businesses and organizations in the healthcare sector or any entity that handles sensitive health information and must comply with HIPAA regulations.
###### Can I switch between default and HIPAA-compliant settings?
Yes, users can toggle the `hipaaEnabled` setting as needed. However, we recommend carefully considering the implications of each option on your data privacy and compliance requirements.
## Where can PHI be used with Vapi?
###### Which endpoints can contain Protected Health Information (PHI)?
When using Vapi with PHI, you may only pass PHI through the `/call` endpoint. All other endpoints in the API Reference should not contain PHI. For example, you should not put PHI in an `/assistant` prompt or in a `/phone-number` label. The restriction applies to all configuration endpoints where data would be stored on Vapi’s platform.
###### Are there specific HIPAA-safe endpoints I should use?
No, there are no designated “HIPAA-safe endpoints.” Instead, when `hipaaEnabled` is turned on, Vapi will only use HIPAA-compliant services (such as Azure OpenAI) for processing PHI through the pipeline. The voice pipeline (STT → LLM → TTS) can process PHI when properly configured, but Vapi does not store this data.
## HIPAA Compliance Configuration
###### How do I enable HIPAA compliance with Vapi?
Enable `hipaaEnabled` at the organization level. This ensures that all appropriate compliance measures are in place across your Vapi implementation. You can also toggle HIPAA-compliance at the assistant-level by setting `Assistant.compliancePlan.hipaaEnabled=true` in your configuration.
###### If I bring my own HIPAA-compliant provider keys, does that make everything compliant?
No. Even when using your own HIPAA-compliant provider keys, it remains your responsibility not to store PHI via Vapi’s endpoints. The model keys are a separate concern from the storage of PHI on Vapi’s platform. You must both use HIPAA-compliant keys AND ensure you’re not storing PHI on Vapi.
## Best Practices
###### What are best practices for ensuring HIPAA compliance with Vapi?
  * Enable `hipaaEnabled` at the organization level
  * Ensure that PHI only passes through the call pipeline and is not stored in configuration
  * Use HIPAA-compliant enterprise accounts with all third-party providers (STT, LLM, TTS)
  * Be mindful of test/demo assistants where compliance might be turned off for testing purposes - never use these with real PHI
  * Remember that with HIPAA compliance enabled, Vapi won’t store logs, recordings, or transcriptions
###### Can I have both HIPAA-compliant and non-HIPAA-compliant assistants?
Yes, but be extremely careful. If you have test or demo assistants where HIPAA compliance is turned off for testing purposes, ensure you never intermingle these with real PHI. It’s safest to enable HIPAA compliance at the organization level to avoid accidental misconfigurations.
###### What is my responsibility under the BAA with Vapi?
Under the Business Associate Agreement (BAA), you agree:
  1. Not to introduce PHI onto Vapi’s platform through its API or dashboard except as permitted
  2. To use HIPAA-compliant accounts with external providers when providing keys
  3. Not to use underlying providers through Vapi without having HIPAA-compliant enterprise accounts with those providers
  4. To use the platform in accordance with all BAA requirements

This guide focuses on configuring tools within your Vapi assistant using the provided sample payload as a reference. We’ll explore how to adapt the existing structure to fit your specific needs and desired functionalities.
## Understanding the Tool Structure
The sample payload demonstrates the configuration for a “function” type tool. Let’s break down its key components:
```

1
| {

---|---  

2
|     "type": "function",

3
|     "messages": [ ... ],

4
|     "function": { ... },

5
|     "async": false,

6
|     "server": { ... }

7
| }

```
  1. **type:** This remains as “function” if you’re setting up an API call.
  2. **messages:** This array holds the messages the AI will communicate to the user at different stages of the tool’s execution.
  3. **function:** Defines the function details:
     * **name:** The unique identifier for your function.
     * **parameters:** (Optional) An object describing the parameters expected by the function.
     * **description:** (Optional) A description of the function’s purpose.
  4. **async:** Set to “true” if the function call should be asynchronous, allowing the AI to continue without waiting for the response. Use “false” for synchronous calls.
  5. **server:** Provides the URL of the server where the function is hosted.
## Adapting the Payload for Your Needs
  1. **Modify Function Details:**
     * Change the “name” to reflect your specific function.
     * Adjust the “parameters” object according to the data your function requires.
     * Update the “description” to accurately explain the function’s purpose.
  2. **Customize Messages:**
     * Edit the content of each message within the “messages” array to align with your desired communication style and information.
     * Add or remove messages as needed. You can include messages like “request-start”, “request-response-delayed”, “request-complete”, and “request-failed” to inform the user about the tool’s progress.
  3. **Set Server URL:**
     * Replace the existing URL in the “server” object with the endpoint of your server hosting the function.
  4. **Choose Asynchronous Behavior (Optional):**
     * Change “async” to “true” if you want the AI to continue without waiting for the function’s response.
### Example Modification
Let’s say you want to create a tool that fetches the weather for a given location. You would modify the payload as follows:
```

1
| {

---|---  

2
|     "type": "function",

3
|     "messages": [

4
|         {

5
|             "type": "request-start",

6
|             "content": "Checking the weather forecast. Please wait..."

7
|         },

8
|         {

9
|             "type": "request-complete",

10
|             "content": "The weather in location is"

11
|         },

12
|         {

13
|             "type": "request-failed",

14
|             "content": "I couldn't get the weather information right now."

15
|         },

16
|         {

17
|             "type": "request-response-delayed",

18
|             "content": "It appears there is some delay in communication with the weather API.",

19
|             "timingMilliseconds": 2000

20
|         }

21
|     ],

22
|     "function": {

23
|         "name": "get_weather",

24
|         "parameters": {

25
|             "type": "object",

26
|             "properties": {

27
|                 "location": {

28
|                     "type": "string"

29
|                 }

30
|             }

31
|         },

32
|         "description": "Retrieves the current weather for a specified location."

33
|     },

34
|     "async": false,

35
|     "server": {

36
|         "url": "https://your-weather-api.com/weather"

37
|     }

38
| }

```
### Adding More Tools
Simply create additional tool objects within the “tools” array, following the same structure and modifying the details as needed. Each tool can have its own unique configuration and messages.
## Request Format: Understanding the Tool Call Request
When your server receives a tool call request from Vapi, it will be in the following format:
```

1
| {

---|---  

2
|     "message": {

3
|         "timestamp": 1678901234567,

4
|         "type": "tool-calls",

5
|         "toolCallList": [

6
|             {

7
|                 "id": "toolu_01DTPAzUm5Gk3zxrpJ969oMF",

8
|                 "name": "get_weather",

9
|                 "arguments": {

10
|                     "location": "San Francisco"

11
|                 }

12
|             }

13
|         ],

14
|         "toolWithToolCallList": [

15
|             {

16
|                 "type": "function",

17
|                 "name": "get_weather",

18
|                 "parameters": {

19
|                     "type": "object",

20
|                     "properties": {

21
|                         "location": {

22
|                             "type": "string"

23
|                         }

24
|                     }

25
|                 },

26
|                 "description": "Retrieves the current weather for a specified location"

27
|             },

28
|             "server": {

29
|                 "url": "https://your-api-server.com/weather"

30
|             },

31
|             "messages": [],

32
|             "toolCall": {

33
|                 "id": "toolu_01DTPAzUm5Gk3zxrpJ969oMF",

34
|                 "type": "function",

35
|                 "function": {

36
|                     "name": "get_weather",

37
|                     "parameters": {

38
|                         "location": "San Francisco"

39
|                     }

40
|                 }

41
|             }

42
|         ],

43
|         "artifact": {

44
|             "messages": []

45
|         },

46
|         "assistant": {

47
|             "name": "Weather Assistant",

48
|             "description": "An assistant that provides weather information",

49
|             "model":{},

50
|             "voice":{},

51
|             "artifactPlans":{},

52
|             "startSpeakingPlan":{}

53
|         },

54
|         "call": {

55
|             "id": "call-uuid",

56
|             "orgId": "org-uuid",

57
|             "type": "webCall",

58
|             "assistant": {}

59
|         }

60
|     }

61
| }

```

## Server Response Format: Providing Results and Context
When your Vapi assistant calls a tool (via the server URL you configured), your server will receive an HTTP request containing information about the tool call. Upon processing the request and executing the desired function, your server needs to send back a response in the following JSON format:
```

1
| {

---|---  

2
|     "results": [

3
|         {

4
|             "toolCallId": "X",

5
|             "result": "Y"

6
|         }

7
|     ]

8
| }

```
**Breaking down the components:**
  * **toolCallId (X):** This is a unique identifier included in the initial request from Vapi. It allows the assistant to match the response with the corresponding tool call, ensuring accurate processing and context preservation.
  * **result (Y):** This field holds the actual output or result of your tool’s execution. The format and content of “result” will vary depending on the specific function of your tool. It could be a string, a number, an object, an array, or any other data structure that is relevant to the tool’s purpose.
**Example:**
Let’s revisit the weather tool example from before. If the tool successfully retrieves the weather for a given location, the server response might look like this:
```

1
| {

---|---  

2
|   "results": [

3
|     {

4
|       "toolCallId": "call_VaJOd8ZeZgWCEHDYomyCPfwN",

5
|       "result": "San Francisco's weather today is 62°C, partly cloudy."

6
|     }

7
|   ]

8
| }

```
**Some Key Points:**
  * Pay attention to the required parameters and response format of your functions.
  * Ensure your server is accessible and can handle the incoming requests from Vapi.
  * Make sure to add “Tools Calls” in both the Server and Client messages and remove the function calling from it.
By following these guidelines and adapting the sample payload, you can easily configure a variety of tools to expand your Vapi assistant’s capabilities and provide a richer, more interactive user experience.

The Google Sheets integration allows your Vapi assistant to interact with Google Sheets in a simple way:
  1. Add new rows to existing Google Sheets
This enables your assistant to record information and add data to spreadsheets directly during phone calls.
The Google Sheets integration currently only supports adding new rows to spreadsheets. It does not support reading from or modifying existing data in the spreadsheet.
## Prerequisites
Before you can use the Google Sheets integration, you need to:
  1. Have a Google Sheets account
  2. Have access to the Vapi Dashboard
  3. Have an assistant created in Vapi
  4. Have a Google Sheet created and ready to receive data
## Setup Steps
### 1. Connect Google Sheets Account
First, you need to connect your Google Sheets account to Vapi:
  1. Navigate to the Vapi Dashboard
  2. Go to **Providers Keys** > **Tools Provider** > **Google Sheets**
  3. Click the **Connect** button
  4. A Google authorization popup will appear
  5. Follow the prompts to authorize Vapi to access your Google Sheets
The authorization process will request access to your Google Sheets.
### 2. Create and Configure Sheets Tool
After connecting your Google Sheets account, create and configure the tool:
  1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Tools** page
  2. Click the **Create Tool** button
  3. Select **Google Sheets** from the available options
  4. Choose the Google Sheets Add Row Tool
  5. Provide a name and description explaining when it should be invoked
  6. Configure the tool with the following required fields:
     * `spreadsheetId`: The ID of your Google Sheet
     * `range`: The sheet name or range (e.g., “Sheet1” or “Sheet1!A:Z”)
To find your spreadsheet ID:
  1. Open your Google Sheet in a browser
  2. Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit`
  3. Copy the SPREADSHEET_ID portion (it’s a long string of letters, numbers, and special characters)
The description field is crucial as it helps the AI model understand when and how to use the tool. Be specific about the scenarios and conditions when the tool should be invoked.
### 3. Add Tool to Assistant
Now, add the Google Sheets tool to your assistant:
  1. Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Assistants** page
  2. Select your assistant
  3. Go to the **Tools** tab
  4. In the tools dropdown, select the Google Sheets tool
  5. Click **Publish** to save your changes
## Tool Configuration
### Google Sheets Add Row Tool
This tool uses the following fields to add data to your spreadsheet:
  * `spreadsheetId`: The ID of your Google Sheet (found in the sheet’s URL)
  * `range`: The range where the data should be added (e.g., “Sheet1” or “Sheet1!A:Z”)
  * `values`: An array of values to be added as a new row
The range field can be specified in two ways:
  1. Just the sheet name (e.g., “Sheet1”) - This will append to the next empty row
  2. Sheet name with range (e.g., “Sheet1!A:Z”) - This will append to the specified range
## Example Usage
Here’s how the tool can be used in your assistant’s configuration:
```
