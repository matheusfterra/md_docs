We’re backed by leading names
ElevenLabs is an AI audio research and deployment company. Our mission is to make content universally accessible in any language and in any voice.  
Our research team develops AI audio models that generate realistic, versatile and contextually-aware speech, voices, and sound effects across 32 languages. Our product team tailors these models to the needs of everyday users, prosumers, and businesses.  
Our technology is used to voice audiobooks and news articles, animate video game characters, help in film pre-production, localize media in entertainment, create dynamic audio content for social media and advertising, and train medical professionals. It has also given back voices to those who have lost them and helped individuals with accessibility needs in their daily lives.  
We develop our tools mindful of their impact. AI voices offer a preview into the future of digital interaction and making them safe is our priority. Our goal is to ensure that our products are developed, deployed and used safely, while continuing to drive positive and creative applications.

### 1. Consider the style of your content
If you create comedic or fast-paced videos, a casual-sounding TikTok text to speech voice may be ideal. However, if you need polished narrations, a more [professional Instagram reels voiceover](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/elevenlabs-for-instagram-reels) might be a better fit.
### 2. Check customization options
A good AI voice generator should allow you to tweak pitch, speed, and emotion to match your brand’s style.

Some AI voice generator options produce unnatural speech. Testing different voices ensures your content sounds engaging.
### Maintain brand consistency
Creators should use the same AI voice for their content to keep a consistent style across all videos.

[Scribe](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-to-text), our Speech to Text model, to speed up their transcription workflow and they've already seen material time savings.
Many transcription models hallucinate when processing multi-language dialogue. Adapt struggled finding tools that could transcribe content that switched from Arabic to Hebrew. Their tools could transcribe the Arabic accurately but when the content switched to Hebrew it would still be transcribed in Arabic, creating unintelligible outputs. ElevenLabs handles these situations better thanks to our multilingual capabilities, thus reducing errors and time spent for review and saving Adapt time, which directly translates to cost savings as well. 
Even with English source content Adapt benefited from material time savings. Adapt recently used Scribe to transcribe 
Scribe correctly understands sentences, creates the right blocks, picks up words that were missed by other models, and even captures sound cues and flags properly, all this contributed towards time and labor savings in Adapt’s localization process. In this sample below, you can see how the final cut from the producers matches Scribe's transcript perfectly, whereas the previous tool used by Adapt creates time misaligned blocks, which forces the producer to break it down and properly time sync it so it matches the audio on screen and the pace of narration.

To allow you more control on your voices we are adding Voice Settings as part of Speech Synthesis , where you can control how similar and varied the voice is! 
We are adding 2 settings that will help you control your voices - this has biggest effect on the voices you clone. One is Stability - which allows you decide on variability of the voice - whether you want it to be more stable and similar between regenerations, or more varied, or expressive. The more varied it is, it might result in slight artifacts and with higher stability, the speech will be cleaner. On the other hand you can also adjust the similarity - the more similar it is, the more it will depend on the voice samples you have uploaded. Similarly, if the samples aren't clean it might result in speech artifacts. If prefer for the voice to be more clear, but similar to generic voices then move this slider to the left!

# AI and Anime: Nik Shaw's Journey with ElevenLabs

Nik Shaw, the creator behind 
### Challenge
For creators like Nik, one of the main challenges lies in bringing authentic, engaging character voices to life, especially when targeting a global audience. Another is effectively pitching new projects to potential investors and platforms. Creators need a captivating concept and if they plan on targeting an international audience, they should also demonstrate how the final product will resonate across languages and cultures.
### Solutions
To address some of these challenges, Nik has turned to our voice AI tools. [**Voice Design**](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/rvg/) helps in the pitching phase: it lets Nik create bespoke character voices from scratch, selecting their attributes like age, gender or accent. This accelerates development, giving Nik the freedom to experiment and establish a clear direction early on. For the series itself, Nik plans to employ professional voice talent, but Voice Design helps pitch the concept to potential investors who get a better feel for the storyline from the outset.
For localization, Nik plans to use [**AI Dubbing**](https://elevenlabs.io/dubbing)**.** This tool offers automated, end-to-end video localization across 29 languages, significantly reducing the time and cost traditionally involved, all while preserving the original speakers’ voices. It's a game-changer for content creators who want to go global and the tool will soon be expanded into the **Dubbing Studio** workflow, enabling users to dub entire movies, as well as generate and edit their transcripts, translations, and timecodes, thus providing extra control over localization. We’ve added this additional control precisely with creators like Nik in mind, who aren’t prepared to compromise on quality and authenticity.
### New standard
Our voice AI tools not only help in overcoming the challenges of character voice development and global reach but are also setting new standards in content creation and localization. These tools offer a blend of creativity, efficiency, and market reach, empowering storytellers like Nik to bring their visions to life and set them in a global context.

Every character voice in a game helps the game's immersiveness and storytelling power. They bring characters to life, making the gaming experience more engaging and memorable. A well-crafted [video game voice](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/voices-for-video-games) can convey emotions, build atmosphere, and deepen player connections with the game’s narrative. 
As gaming evolves, the demand for high-quality, realistic voices continues to grow, highlighting the importance of effective (and efficient) voice design in game development.
## **Key takeaways**
  * Realistic AI-generated character voices enhance player immersion.
  * AI voice generators offer high-quality, cost-effective solutions.
  * ElevenLabs provides versatile tools like Voice Library, voice design, and API integration well-suited for game use cases.
  * ElevenLabs Multilingual and contextual [TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) capabilities cater to diverse gaming audiences.
## **How realistic are AI voices?**
AI voices have advanced significantly. Now, we get lifelike quality that can be indistinguishable from real voices. Modern AI voice generators use sophisticated algorithms and deep learning to mimic natural speech patterns, intonations, and emotional nuances. 
For example, [ElevenLabs’ Turbo v2 model](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) is designed to produce highly realistic voices with minimal latency, enhancing the realism of AI-generated character voices in games. This advanced speech synthesis technology allows for the creation of crisp, natural sounding voices that can be tailored to each character's personality, providing a versatile character voice generator for developers.
ElevenLabs boasts a wide range of choices: [epic](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/epic-voices), [romantic](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/romantic-story-voices), and [narrator](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/narrator-voices) voices, elderly [male](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/elderly-male-voices) and [female](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/elderly-female-voices) choices, and [angry](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/angry-voices), [seductive](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/seductive-voices), and [sultry](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/sultry-voices) options. Whatever you need, our Voice Library has you covered.
## **What makes a good AI voice generator?**
A good AI voice generator excels in versatility, realism, and ease of integration. It should offer a wide range of voice options, including different accents, languages, and emotional tones. [ElevenLabs’ Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library), for instance, provides a diverse collection of voices that can be tailored to fit various character profiles. 
Additionally, features like [ElevenLabs' contextual and multilingual TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/languages) use an [advanced API](https://elevenlabs.io/api) to create authentic and nuanced character voices. Leveraging artificial intelligence, these tools can produce natural sounding synthetic voices - or even create a customizable clone of the user's own voice.
You can get a taste of the voices available in ElevenLabs Voice Library here:
## **AI voices for video game characters: the benefits**
Using AI voices for video game characters offers numerous benefits. Firstly, it is cost-effective compared to hiring multiple voice actors. Secondly, it provides flexibility in voice selection and customization, allowing developers to easily create a natural sounding voice, which can be customized to fit an array of different characters. 
Lastly, AI voice generators like ElevenLabs’ can quickly produce high-quality (128kbps) VOs, significantly reducing production time and costs. This efficiency enables developers to focus more on other critical - but more creative - aspects of game development.
## **AI voice generators in game development**
Integrating AI into video game development involves choosing the right tools and platforms. ElevenLabs offers a [super low-latency API](https://elevenlabs.io/api) that seamlessly integrates with various game engines, making it easier to implement AI voices. 
Developers can use the [Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library) to select or customize voices and leverage the voice design tool to create unique character sounds (for instance by inserting natural sounding pauses, regional accents, or tailoring speech to suit specific emotions). Additionally, the [contextual TTS feature](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) ensures that voices adapt to in-game scenarios, enhancing realism and player immersion - if your character is in the heat of battle, they'll sound like they really are.
## **How-to: ElevenLabs Voice Design**
ElevenLabs Voice Design is a powerful tool for creating realistic AI-generated character voices.
  1. Start by logging in to ElevenLabs to access the [Voice Library.](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library) Then choose a base voice that matches your character's profile.
  2. Use the voice design feature to tweak pitch, speed, and emotional tone, ensuring the voice aligns with your character’s personality.
  3. For multilingual games, utilize the multilingual [TTS ](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech)to create consistent character voices across different languages.
  4. The API can be used to integrate these voices directly into your game, streamlining the development process.
  5. Speech can be edited like text, so if script changes are made late on, you don't need to start from scratch with the game audio.

Press 1 for sales. Press 2 for support. Press 3 to hear these options again. We’ve all been there—stuck in a traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system that doesn’t understand our needs. It’s frustrating, outdated, and often leads to long wait times.
But what if phone support could be smarter? 
AI-powered systems leverage [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai#ai-agents) and natural language processing (NLP) to provide a more intuitive experience. Instead of rigid menus, customers can speak naturally, get instant resolutions, and avoid unnecessary transfers. This is why so many businesses are making the switch.
## **What are traditional IVR systems?**
Interactive voice response (IVR) has been a staple in customer communication for decades. These systems use pre-recorded voice prompts and keypad inputs to route calls. While they help manage high call volumes, they often fail when customers have complex queries or need personalized interactions.
IVR systems have a few common features:
  * Rigid menu structure that forces customers through lengthy options.
  * Limited understanding of customer inputs, often requiring human agents for resolution.
  * High call abandonment rates due to customer frustration and slow responses.
These systems were built for a different era—one where patience was expected. But today’s customers demand fast, intuitive service. And outdated IVR just isn’t cutting it anymore. That’s why businesses are turning to AI-powered systems for a smarter, smoother customer experience.
## How AI phone systems are transforming customer support
Conversational AI is changing [customer support](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/customer-support-with-conversational-ai-and-text-to-speech) for the better. Unlike traditional IVR, which forces customers through rigid menu structures, AI-powered systems understand natural speech. No more pressing buttons or repeating yourself. Just talk, and the system responds—like a real conversation.
This is possible thanks to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. AI doesn’t just recognize words—it understands customer intent. It processes complex queries, pulls in relevant customer data, and delivers fast, accurate responses in [natural-sounding speech](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-generate-natural-sounding-voices-with-text-to-speech-ai). The result? Fewer transfers, quicker resolutions, and a smoother customer experience.
AI-driven call routing takes it a step further. Instead of sending customers down the wrong path, AI phone answering systems analyze past interactions and real-time data to route calls efficiently. No waiting, no frustration—just instant connections to the right agent or automated solution.
Businesses benefit too. Automating routine inquiries reduces the need for human agents, cutting operational costs while improving response times. AI also gathers valuable data on customer behavior, helping companies fine-tune their support strategies.
With Conversational AI, customer support feels effortless. It’s faster, smarter, and far more human.

## AI scenarios
An [ElevenLabs Grant](https://elevenlabs.io/startup-grants) helped ThisGen develop lifelike caller voices. These include different ages, genders, accents, and emotions. “ _The grant gave us the tools to build a platform that reflects the real challenges and diversity of emergency response_ ,” says Zak Randall, CEO of ThisGen.
00:00 / 06:32
Many dispatch centers in the U.S. are understaffed, with vacancy rates over 25%. Training new staff quickly is critical. ThisGen’s platform makes it easier with realistic simulations — centers can try the technology, see its value, and start improving training immediately.
00:00 / 01:41
00:00 / 01:50
In just a few months, over one hundred dispatch centers have used the realistic training simulations, with growing interest from emergency response teams across the country. Its realistic scenarios have helped them build trust and a growing community. And Emergency Communications Centers (ECCs) are using it for more than just new hires — finding it invaluable for on-the-job training, remedial training, and keeping the full team prepared on high stakes, less frequent situations. ThisGen is also expanding the platform with features like multi-participant calls and background noise, to make training more immersive.
“ _ElevenLabs’ voice technology helps us create real scenarios that prepare dispatchers for all kinds of calls_ ,” says Randall. By blending AI with practical needs, ThisGen.ai is changing how emergency response teams prepare for the unexpected.

  * **Turnover expenses:** Call centers face turnover rates of 30-45% annually. Each departing agent represents $10,000-$20,000 in lost investment and replacement costs, creating a costly cycle of continuous hiring and training.
  * **Infrastructure requirements:** Physical space ($25-$50 per square foot annually), equipment ($1,500-$3,000 per workstation), telecommunication systems ($700-$1,000 per user), and ongoing utilities all contribute to substantial overhead costs.
  * **Scaling challenges:** Traditional centers must staff for peak volumes, resulting in costly idle time during slower periods. Offering 24/7 service demands premium pay for overnight shifts, while unexpected high call volumes often lead to customer frustration and lost business.
## AI call center cost structure
AI call centers operate on a fundamentally different cost model, shifting expenses from ongoing labor to technology investment and subscription services. This approach creates a more predictable and often more cost-effective financial structure.
  * **Implementation costs:** Initial setup includes AI platform licensing (ranging from $25-$1,320 per month per concurrent channel) and integration with existing systems. According to ElevenLabs' pricing, businesses can start with basic conversational AI capabilities for as little as $5 per month, with enterprise solutions scaling based on volume.
  * **Operational expenses:** AI solutions typically follow subscription-based pricing (per-minute, per-call, or concurrent channel models). These costs increase linearly with usage rather than in large staffing increments, making scaling more predictable and eliminating the need for most physical infrastructure.
  * **Maintenance requirements:** While traditional centers have ongoing hiring and training expenses, AI systems primarily require content and knowledge base updates to keep responses current. Software updates are generally included in subscription pricing, significantly reducing ongoing maintenance overhead.
  * **Scalability advantages:** AI systems can handle multiple customer interactions simultaneously and scale instantly during high volume periods without additional costs. This eliminates the staffing inefficiencies inherent in traditional models where capacity must be maintained regardless of demand.
## Direct cost comparison analysis
Traditional call centers typically cost $5-$25 per customer interaction when all expenses are factored in, varying based on call complexity and duration. AI solutions dramatically reduce this figure to $0.50-$5 per interaction, representing potential savings of 70-90%.
This cost difference becomes more pronounced at scale. Traditional centers face step-function increases when expanding. Adding agents requires full salary packages, physical space comes in large increments, and equipment purchases happen in bulk. On the other hand, AI systems scale gradually with minute-based or usage-based pricing allowing for incremental growth without physical expansion.
The contrast is particularly stark for 24/7 coverage. Traditional approaches require night shift premiums (typically 15-30% higher wages), weekend and holiday differentials, and minimum staffing regardless of call volume. AI maintains the same cost structure regardless of time, with no premiums and capacity that adjusts automatically to demand. This translates to investment recovery timelines that differ significantly.
Traditional centers typically require 12-24 months to recoup initial investments with high ongoing costs. Meanwhile, AI implementations often show positive ROI within 3-9 months due to dramatically lower ongoing expenses.
## Case ctudy: Thoughtly's experience with ElevenLabs
"I love Tessa because she never sleeps!"
That's how one sales team member described [Thoughtly's AI agent](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/thoughtly)—powered by ElevenLabs' voice technology. Tessa works 24/7. She handles calls in 50 seconds flat. And customers can't tell she's not human.
The partnership began in October 2023 when Thoughtly integrated ElevenLabs' turbo voice model. The results were immediate. Millions of calls automated. Customer wait times slashed. Cost-per-interaction plummeted.
What makes this case study remarkable isn't just efficiency—it's the emotional connection. Customers develop rapport with these AI agents, completely unaware they're synthetic. One business owner was repeatedly confused when callers asked for "Gabriel." He eventually realized Gabriel was his AI agent, whose voice was so convincingly human that customers thought he was a real employee.
For global operations, the system seamlessly handles multiple languages and accents—Latin American Spanish, European French, regional American dialects—all without the multilingual staffing costs that would cripple a traditional call center budget.
The result? Lower costs. Happier customers. Zero wait times. And a fundamental shift in what's possible for call center economics.

# AiMation Studios uses ElevenLabs to bring characters to life
Feb 12, 2025 • 4 minutes reading time
AiMation Studios uses ElevenLabs Voice AI and sound effects models to bring characters to life and speed up its pipeline.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F0lw0n80yhv4g-Where%20the%20Robots%20Grow%20Blog%20Cover.webp&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F4u2fc1dyx7-aimation-1_1.webp&w=3840&q=95)

  * [Looking Ahead](https://elevenlabs.io/#2-looking-ahead)
Tom Paton, founder of _Where the Robots Grow_ , one of the first fully AI-animated feature films — and they did it in just 90 days with a team of nine. 
Where the Robots Grow follows the journey of a farming robot named Cru, who discovers a human baby in a distant world and must navigate his newfound purpose under the guidance of an AI companion, POP. It features rich dialogue with lead actor Taylor Clarke-Hill voicing multiple characters, dynamically changed using ElevenLabs [Voice AI](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-changer) technology.
Paton says ElevenLabs enables AiMation to generate high-quality AI voices, enhance sound design with AI-generated effects tailored to each scene and to streamline production, cutting traditional voiceover costs and timelines. If he'd made Where the Robots Grow using traditional methods it would have cost millions and taken years to complete.
Since that project, AiMation has refined its pipeline further. If they made the same movie today, it would take just eight weeks with a four-person team. ElevenLabs' [AI-driven voice generation](https://elevenlabs.io/media-and-entertainment) significantly reduces post-production labor, cutting down ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) time and making real-time adjustments effortless.
## **Speed, Efficiency, and Cost Savings**
The film industry is known for long production cycles and high costs. AiMation is proving AI can change that. Producing _Where the Robots Grow_ using traditional methods would have cost millions and taken years. Instead, AiMation completed the film for a fraction of the price in a fraction of the time.
AiMation isn’t stopping at animation. They’re using ElevenLabs to power AI-driven reality TV, where Unreal Engine characters engage in unscripted interactions. AI-generated voices drive the narrative, making it possible to create engaging AI-generated reality shows at scale.
ElevenLabs’ sound effects have also become a crucial asset. AiMation uses them for everything from ambient noise to dynamic character dialogue — like a distant voice calling for help — without relying on large sound libraries or manual recordings.
Paton isn’t just rethinking production — he’s rethinking distribution. Instead of following the subscription-based streaming model, AiMation is pioneering a microtransaction-based platform. The idea? Replace traditional theatrical releases with a pay-per-view model optimized for AI-generated films and series.
By controlling both production and distribution, AiMation can scale rapidly while ensuring content meets high quality standards. With _Where the Robots Grow_ serving as a proof of concept, the studio is now developing 25 additional AI-driven films, all powered by ElevenLabs technology.
## **Looking Ahead**
ElevenLabs is more than just a tool for AiMation — it’s the backbone of their creative process, according to Paton. From AI-powered voice acting to next-generation sound design, the studio has built an efficient, scalable production model that wouldn’t be possible without AI.
As Paton puts it, _“Every time we tweak our workflow, we go back to ElevenLabs — it’s the one tool that never leaves our pipeline.”_
As AI continues to reshape creative industries, AiMation Studios is proving what’s possible. And with ElevenLabs, they’re doing it faster, cheaper, and better than ever before.

# Alec Wilcock on becoming a top affiliate for ElevenLabs 
Apr 15, 2025 • 5 minutes reading time
![Alec Wilcock](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fn5tjdmyua1p-ElevenLabs-Alec-Wilcock-Blog.webp&w=3840&q=95)![Alec Wilcock](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Frmy58d28ml-ElevenLabs-Alec-Wilcock-Square.webp&w=3840&q=95)
[Contact Sales](https://elevenlabs.io/contact-sales)[Affiliate Program](https://www.elevenlabs.io/affiliate)
Alec Wilcock runs a growing YouTube channel focused on innovation, AI and YouTube. Through consistent posting and an authentic, educational style, he has built an engaged audience of 70K subscribers and reached +100 million views highlighting tech companies.
Since joining the ElevenLabs affiliate program in 2023, he’s turned his genuine enthusiasm for voice technology into a five-figure income stream. His success is linked to developing a method to create videos that not only educate, but also convert.
**Why the ElevenLabs affiliate model works for Alec**
Alec attributes his success to his authenticity. He only recommends products he truly loves. 
Before joining the affiliate program, he was already spreading the word about ElevenLabs. As a creator and user of the product, it was easy for him to talk about its features. He wanted to share valuable information to his subscribers. Earning was the icing on the cake.
Moreover, his viewers are already interested in content creation, tech and AI. The product naturally fits their interests. This alignment with the audience is what allows for sustained referrals that snowball every month, from videos he created long ago. 
**A creator focused on practical value**
Alec discovered ElevenLabs after hearing one of our AI-generated voices online. Intrigued, he traced it back to our platform, experimented with it himself and quickly became a regular user. 
At the time, few creators were covering ElevenLabs in detail. Alec’s early tutorial broke through quickly, ranking at the top of YouTube search results and driving a steady stream of signups. 
Being a client first helped Alec find ways to authentically promote ElevenLabs, creating digestible “how-to” guides with solid watch-time. We strongly encourage affiliates to create an account and explore features so they can understand the full potential of our products. 
**Educational Content that convert**
Alec doesn’t just describe product features — he shows how to use them. His videos walk viewers through specific workflows, such as generating custom voices or narrating scripts. This practical, tutorial-style content performs especially well in the affiliate program.
His recent guide on voice design and prompting is a strong example:
By staying up to date with product improvements and testing new features himself, Alec can create content that’s both relevant and actionable for creators, marketers, and AI enthusiasts.
**Ask for the click**
Alec’s high conversion rate comes down to one strategy : he always asks for the click. In every video, he reminds viewers that signing up through his affiliate link supports his channel, at no extra cost to them. It’s a simple message, but it drives results. As Alec puts it, “if you’re giving people value, they’ll want to give back.”
He places his ElevenLabs affiliate link prominently in video descriptions, above the fold, and has call to action regularly in his video. Each mention is tied to a clear value proposition, not just a promotion but an invitation to try the tool with real benefits.
In his videos, Alec also points out that free accounts can quickly hit usage limits. By recommending that viewers consider a paid plan from the start — especially if they plan to use the tool regularly or commercially — he helps set realistic expectations. This approach not only improves the user experience but also increases the likelihood of generating affiliate commissions.
**Tips for new ElevenLabs Affiliates**
You don’t need a large audience to succeed in the affiliate program. Alec’s strategy works for channels of all sizes. His advice : 
  * Use the product. Real experience results in authentic content. 
  * Show specific use cases. Don’t limit yourself to general reviews. Walk your audience into what ElevenLabs can do for them.
  * Mention your affiliate link multiple times.
  * Be consistent : referral earnings compound over time.

# An update on our preparation for elections 
Oct 29, 2024 • 5 minutes reading time
Throughout 2024, a pivotal election year in countries across the globe, we’ve taken concrete steps designed to prevent the misuse of our tools
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=%2Fplaceholder-16x9.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=%2Fplaceholder-1x1.jpg&w=3840&q=95)
At ElevenLabs, we’re committed to making content accessible and engaging across any language, voice, and sound. We believe deeply in the power of our technology to create a more connected and informed world, and in turn, to be a force for good for the democratic process. We’ve [advocates](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/bill-weihl-continues-to-fight-for-climate-policy-progress-while-battling-als), supporting their efforts to make change and improve lives. And our work to remove barriers to knowledge, participation, and community has only begun. 
We also believe that it’s on all of us – industry, governments, civil society, and individuals – to not just promote the democratic process, but to protect it. [Throughout 2024](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-elevenlabs-is-preparing-for-elections-in-2024), a pivotal election year in countries across the globe, we’ve taken concrete steps designed to prevent the misuse of our tools. In advance of the November 5th U.S. election, here’s an update on our efforts.
**Policies**
We revised our [Prohibited Use Policy](https://elevenlabs.io/use-policy) to strengthen and clarify our rules regarding the use of our tools in the context of elections.
  * **Ban on campaigning and the impersonation of candidates.** We strictly prohibit the use of our tools for political campaigning, including promoting or advocating for a particular candidate, issue, or position, or soliciting votes or financial contributions. We also prohibit the use of our tools to mimic the voices of political candidates and elected government officials.
  * **Ban on voter suppression and disruptions of the electoral process.** We prohibit the use of our tools to incite, engage in, or facilitate voter suppression or other disruptions of electoral or civic processes. This includes creating, distributing, or facilitating the spread of misleading information.
**Prevention**
We’ve enhanced our safeguards to prevent the misuse of our tools in the context of elections. 
  * **User screening.** All users of our voice cloning tools must provide contact and payment information, which helps us block accounts linked to fraudulent activity or high-risk geographies at sign-up.
  * **“No-Go” Voices.** Our No-Go Voice technology blocks the voices of hundreds of candidates, elected officials, other political figures, and celebrities from being generated. We’ve continuously expanded this safeguard to increase its effectiveness, and we monitor and take enforcement actions against users who attempt to generate blocked voices.
**Detection and Enforcement**
To complement our preventative measures, we’ve ramped up our detection and enforcement capabilities.
  * **Monitoring for misuse.** Our improved proprietary classifiers, including one specifically designed to identify political content, alongside automated moderation and human reviewers, help us detect content that violates our terms. We also work with external threat intelligence teams that provide insights on potential misuse aimed at disrupting elections, and we have set up information sharing channels with government and industry partners.
  * **Strong enforcement.** When we identify misuse, we take decisive action, including removing voices, placing users on probation, banning users from our platform, and if appropriate, reporting to authorities. If you come across problematic content that you think may have originated from ElevenLabs, please [let us know](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_13297797982993=report_content).
  * **Support for government efforts.** We believe that government action is critical to deterring misuse. In July, we were proud to [announce](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/elevenlabs-supports-congressional-efforts-to-advance-ai-safety-and-innovation) our support for the _Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act,_ bipartisan legislation led by Senators Amy Klobuchar, Josh Hawley, Chris Coons, Susan Collins, Maria Cantwell, Todd Young, John Hickenlooper, and Marsha Blackburn, which would hold accountable bad actors who use AI in campaign ads to deceive voters. We’ll continue to work with policymakers in the U.S. and across the globe on AI safety initiatives, including those related to elections.
**Provenance and Transparency**
Enabling the clear identification of AI-generated content, including through broad collaboration, remains a key aspect of ElevenLabs’ responsible development efforts.
  * **AI Speech Classifier.** Our [AI Speech Classifier](https://elevenlabs.io/ai-speech-classifier), available to the public since [June 2023](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/ai-speech-classifier), lets anyone upload an audio sample for analysis as to whether it originated from ElevenLabs. By making this tool public, we aim to limit the spread of misinformation by making the source of audio easier to identify.
  * **Collaborating with industry.** When it comes to AI content provenance and transparency, we can’t go it alone—an industry-wide effort is a necessity.
  * **Supporting third-party detection tools.** We work with third-party AI safety companies to improve their tools for identifying AI-generated content, including election-related deepfakes. In July, we [partnered](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/reality-defender) with 
In the days and weeks ahead, we’ll keep learning and refining these safeguards. We recognize that we can’t foresee every way that our tools may be used. But we’ll continue to take robust action to prevent abuse, while deploying our technology to create a more connected and informed world.

Across six in-person events, three community events, and a global virtual gathering hosted on our Discord server, builders spent 40 hours bringing to life innovative AI agents using ElevenLabs and partner technologies from PostHog, Lovable, Clerk, Make, PICA, fal.ai, Vercel and Mistral.
We were overwhelmed with more than 300 high-quality projects making it incredibly tough for our judges, Mati Staniszewski (CEO ElevenLabs), Guillermo Rauch (CEO Vercel), James Hawkins (CEO of PostHog), Anton Osika (CEO of Lovable), Bryan Kim (Partner at a16z) and Justine Moore (Partner at a16z), to choose the winners.
Without further ado, we're excited to present to you the winning projects of the worldwide hackathon as well as a recap of the six in-person events around the world.
## Global top prize

## Online hackathon winners
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Frctl6zflqic-Awards%202.webp&w=3840&q=95)
While we of course love hacking together in person, we also wanted to include our global community in the hackathon. So we took to our Discord server to host a virtual chapter of the hackathon. Hundreds of builders from all over the world across all timezones joined in to hack together. It was very wholesome to see everyone collaborating and helping each other out.
Over the past couple of days, our panel of judges comprised of Mati Staniszewski (CEO ElevenLabs), Guillermo Rauch (CEO Vercel), James Hawkins (CEO of PostHog), Anton Osika (CEO of Lovable), Bryan Kim (Partner at a16z) and Justine Moore (Partner at a16z), reviewed your projects and selected the winners.
### 1st Prize - Hugo Tour Guide
Yilun Sun (Product Manager and Designer), Qiang Fang (Backend Engineer), David Chen (Frontend Engineer), Aiden Zhao (AI Engineer), a four person team from California, USA, built an impressively feature rich conversational travel agent providing a personalized, location-aware travel experience.
The team is planning to continue working on the project to turn it into a real product, and the first price, Apple Mac Minis for each team member, will be very helpful for them to bring Hugo to market.
### 2nd Prize - Pep - your compassionate Physical Therapy Agent
Runner up, 
Built by Feng Yan, and Lora Xie, a two person team collaborating across the US and China, is a great example of how we can utilize AI technologies to improve the lives of people around the world. For their efforts, they take home a Teenage Engineering OB-4, portable loudspeaker, the perfect companion to make sure Pep's voice is heard.
### 3rd Prize - Agent SFX
Coming in third, 
Using vision models on fal.ai, the agent analyzes the game's node structure and screenshots and then gets to work generating voiceovers and sound effects that the developer can use in their game. The solution during the hackathon was initially built for the open source 
Built by game developers Arian Allenson Valdez, and Maria Mikhaela Magpoc from the Philippines, the team can look forward to a Shure MV6 microphone each, which should serve them well during their late night gaming sessions.

# Narrating AnyTopic's audiobooks
Jun 21, 2024 • 3 minutes reading time
ElevenLabs voices educational content
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F7kb3nx7ce08-anytopic.webp&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F7kb3nx7ce08-anytopic.webp&w=3840&q=95)
Users enter a topic or a question, and the platform finds top-matching online content: news, blogs, existing podcasts, and more. Then, the app creates a mini audiobook from this material, ranging in length from 3 - 25 minutes long.
These customized, bite-size episodes are designed to fit into users' busy lives, perfect for listening during the commute or when winding down in the evening. The app's personalization features tailor each audiobook to the user’s interests and learning pace, providing customized content for each individual.
**Choosing ElevenLabs**
When AnyTopic was starting out, it was focused on finding the most cutting-edge solutions. 
“We were doing research on the most advanced models for voice generation, with the goal of using one of these models to generate personalized [AI audiobooks.](https://elevenlabs.io/use-cases/audiobooks)” Sam Wesley, Co-founder & CTO
Of course, an audiobook can't exist without a narrator. But using traditional voiceover artists was out of the question.
They needed an AI voice generator that was non-robotic and expressive. It had to keep users engaged, just like listening to a great teacher. But they also needed software that was going to support high-quality audio. They knew that poor audio quality would make learners far less likely to want to keep listening.
“Upon discovering ElevenLabs, which stood out as one of the most human-sounding options, we tested it and were impressed with the quality.”
Of course, selecting the model was just the first step—they then needed to integrate it with their app. Thankfully, this was seamless. “We were able to easily incorporate the ElevenLabs voice API as the final step in our established [AI audiobook](https://elevenlabs.io/use-cases/audiobooks) generation pipeline", the team explains.
ElevenLabs real-time latency generates audio content near-instantly, meaning learners can dive into a subject without long waiting times. Plus, the API integration means users can handle everything in one easy-to-use interface, making learning quick and simple on the go.
The app is still in the beta stage of development, but promises great things. 
“We’re excited about the future of personalized content—particularly in the audio space” says Daniel Rascon, Co-founder and CEO of AnyTopic. “ElevenLabs has been helpful to help us bring this vision to life a lot faster and at the level of quality we’re looking for. We’re excited to create more engaging audio experiences for our listeners.”

**Effortlessly beautiful demos**
Potential customers want to see the product—not just hear about it from a rep. Unfortunately, creating interactive product demos is hard and often requires engineering resources that most marketing, sales, and product teams don’t have. Some companies turn to recorded demos to showcase their products, but these videos are hard to produce and become outdated quickly. 
**Integrating automated voiceovers**
Many customers wanted to include voiceovers with their product demo to share additional context with potential buyers. Last year, Arcade turned to AI synthetic voices because it’s easy to create and edit across a team. They got set up with an alternative to ElevenLabs but heard from customers that it didn’t sound natural and lacked the languages and accents they needed.
In May, Arcade switched to ElevenLabs in search of a human-like, emotionally rich Text-to-speech solution. In the two months since migrating, AI voiceover usage doubled and quickly became one of their most used and talked-about features.
“The big differentiator is Arcade's voiceover feature, where you can write in a script and get an AI-generated voice (yes, even with a British accent) to give crystal clear instructions to merge visual and audial directions throughout your product demo.” 
**Going multilingual**
After seeing success with English, the Arcade team expanded to 29 languages so customers could optimize conversion by localizing content for global audiences. 
Check out these live customer demos created with Arcade using ElevenLabs voiceovers in English and German:
  * English: 
  * English: 
  * German: 
“Our mission at Arcade is to enable teams to create beautiful demos in minutes. Partnering with ElevenLabs helped us take another step forward as our customers can now incorporate high-quality audio, effortlessly.” Caroline Clark, CEO and founder of Arcade.
**About Arcade**

Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create effortlessly beautiful demos -- in minutes. Designed for ease of use, Arcade removes the creative and technical barriers often felt by teams wanting to showcase their product on a website, content, or social media.

Arianna Huffington turns to ElevenLabs Voice AI technology to refresh the preface of her book Thrive for its 10th anniversary. 
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fq24grzm6j6h-Arianna-cover.webp&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fxcxrq7ftwxr-Arianna-1_1.webp&w=3840&q=95)
Arianna Huffington, founder of Thrive Global and The Huffington Post, is marking the 10th anniversary of her bestselling book Thrive with a newly recorded preface — powered by ElevenLabs [Voice AI](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) technology.
Using her AI-cloned voice, Arianna Huffington recorded the introduction to the re-released audiobook without the constraints of studio time or scheduling conflicts. This approach made the project possible while saving thousands in production costs. 
00:00 / 13:14
Beyond Thrive, Huffington has joined [Iconic Voices](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/iconic-voices) on the ElevenLabs Reader app, making her newsletter and articles available in her own voice. This gives audiences an immersive way to engage with her insights on well-being and productivity.
AI voice technology is transforming how content is created and delivered. For authors, it means books can be updated or republished without the friction of traditional audiobook production. For news and media, it enables faster, more accessible reporting — making it easier to deliver content at scale while keeping the human voice at the center.
In an era where information consumption is increasingly multimodal, text-based content is no longer the only way audiences engage with news and storytelling. Many readers now prefer to listen to news rather than read it, whether during their commute, workout, or daily tasks. For example, 
Huffington’s collaboration with ElevenLabs is one example of how AI voice is unlocking new possibilities for storytelling. Whether for books, journalism, or real-time updates, ElevenLabs is making high-quality audio creation effortless.
She wrote on X: “I always love talking about the incredible ways AI is transforming our world — especially in healthcare and well-being. But here’s a new one: AI has captured not only my voice, but, yes, my Greek accent! Thanks to the[ Eleven Reader app](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/introducing-elevenlabs-reader-app), you can now listen to AI-Arianna read my newsletter and articles. Let me know what you think — does my AI voice do justice to my Greek roots? And, equally important for Greeks — will AI also be able to accurately simulate yogurt and feta cheese?”

### Bringing "Dil se Dil tak" to life
Audio Pitara's flagship project, "Dil se Dil tak," is a daily podcast featuring romantic stories voiced by ElevenLabs. Initially, they kept the AI nature of the voice under wraps, concerned about potential audience reactions.
The results were astounding. Tapan Gupta, Co-Founder of Audio Pitara, shares:
> We asked our friends and people from the voicing industry for their thoughts on the podcast and the narrator's voice. To our delight, everyone loved both the story and the voice, remarking that it sounded like one of us was narrating the story. No one suspected it was an AI voice.

**Auto regeneration**
Every time you generate audio, we check for mispronunciations and unwanted artifacts. If we find any issues, the system automatically regenerates the audio at no extra cost.
You can enable this feature in two places:
  * In **Settings** while editing a specific chapter:
  * In the **Convert dialogue window** to apply automatic regenerations across an entire project:
**Feedback**
We’ve also introduced a **thumbs-down feedback button** which lets you flag sub-par audio generations. This feedback helps us refine our internal error detection and improve future results.
**Playback speed**
These updates, along with the ability to playback audio at 2x speed, have reduced the time to needed to quality-check long form content by up to 70% among our beta group.

# Automated vs human sales calls: when to use AI
Mar 7, 2025 • 6 minutes reading time
Learn when to let AI handle sales calls, and when humans need to take the reins.

### **Summary**
  * AI sales calls handle the early stages of the sales process by qualifying leads, answering common questions, and automating repetitive tasks.
  * AI improves efficiency by ensuring sales reps focus on high-value conversations rather than wasting time on uninterested prospects.
  * However, human sales representatives are essential for closing deals, as they bring emotional intelligence, trust-building skills, and the ability to navigate complex negotiations.
  * The most effective sales strategies combine AI and human expertise, using AI to streamline the process while relying on humans to secure commitments and build long-term relationships.
Sales calls have changed. Once a game of sheer persistence, it’s now a data-driven process where AI-powered sales tools and human sales reps work together. But when should you let AI sales calls take the lead? And when is the human touch essential?
Today’s sales landscape is all about efficiency. AI in sales speeds up lead qualification, automates repetitive tasks, and ensures reps spend time on the most promising leads. Meanwhile, human sales professionals bring emotional intelligence and strategic thinking to complex customer interactions. 
In this article, we’ll break down the AI vs. human debate—helping you decide when to automate and when to rely on people to maximize sales success.
## **What is an AI-powered sales call?**
Imagine a sales call where no one dials a number, no one repeats the same pitch a hundred times a day, and no one wastes time on uninterested prospects. Instead, an AI-powered sales agent does the talking—engaging leads, answering questions, and moving potential customers through the sales funnel with precision. This isn’t the future. It’s happening now.
[Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai#ai-agents) is at the core of this transformation. Unlike simple robocalls, AI sales calls are dynamic, using natural language processing to interact with leads in a human-like way. Businesses can build their own AI sales reps, training them with key product knowledge, customer data, and sales strategies. 
The result? A highly efficient, AI-powered cold calling system that qualifies leads, nurtures interest, and handles early-stage customer interactions—all without human intervention.
These [Conversational AI sales tools](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-conversational-ai) don’t just follow a script. They adapt. By analyzing past interactions, tracking customer behavior, and integrating with CRM systems, AI sales agents can personalize their approach, offering relevant insights and responses. They identify the most promising leads, engage them with personalized script generation, and push them further down the sales cycle.
But while AI in sales excels at lead qualification and keeping prospects engaged, it’s not quite ready to replace human sales reps entirely. Closing a deal often requires emotional intelligence, deep trust, and the ability to read between the lines—something AI, for now, can’t fully replicate. 
Instead, businesses are finding the perfect balance: letting AI handle the repetitive tasks and early-stage conversations while human agents step in when it’s time to seal the deal.
## Why you still need the human touch in sales
AI is changing the game, but it hasn’t replaced the players. AI-powered sales tools are excellent at lead qualification, analyzing customer data, [bringing your CRM to life](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/setting-up-ai-voice-agents-with-salesforce-for-personalized-crm), and guiding prospects through the early stages of the sales funnel. But when it comes to closing deals, building genuine connections, and handling complex interactions, nothing beats a human sales rep.
Sales isn’t just about delivering the right information—it’s about understanding emotions. A prospect might hesitate, ask a vague question, or give off subtle signs of doubt. Emotional intelligence allows sales professionals to pick up on these cues, pivot their approach, and tailor their pitch in real time. AI cold calling tools can recognize tone and sentiment, but they can’t replicate the instinct and experience of a seasoned sales agent.
Then there’s relationship building. B2B deals, high-ticket sales, and long-term contracts require more than just data-driven persuasion. They need trust. Human sales reps can read between the lines, adjust to the unique customer needs, and create a personal connection that AI simply can’t match. Follow-ups, strategic negotiations, and handling objections all demand a level of nuance that AI sales calls aren’t quite ready for.
The best sales teams aren’t choosing between AI and human agents—they’re combining the two. Conversational AI has a wide range of [use cases](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/best-use-cases-for-conversational-ai-agents) when it comes to sales, increasing efficiency, automates repetitive tasks, and keeps sales reps focused on high-value conversations. But at the end of the day, it’s the human touch that turns interest into commitment and prospects into loyal customers.

## Final thoughts
AI is changing sales, but it’s not replacing sales reps—it’s making them stronger. AI-powered sales tools handle the grunt work: lead qualification, data analysis, and follow-ups, allowing sales teams to focus on what they do best—building relationships and closing deals.
The smartest sales strategies don’t choose between AI and human reps—they combine them. AI cold calling tools work tirelessly to engage the right prospects, while human agents bring the emotional intelligence needed to seal the deal. The result? More efficiency, better conversations, and higher conversion rates.
With ElevenLabs Conversational AI, you can take your sales process to the next level. Automate where it makes sense. Personalize where it matters.

# Reclaiming a voice: how AI helped a CEO speak again

AI technology restores Ben Baldanza’s communication abilities post-ALS diagnosis

The disease progressively impaired his motor skills and significantly affected his speech, making his ongoing work as a board observer, teacher, writer, and podcaster a challenge. Rather than step back, Ben and his wife, Marcia Baldanza, went looking for AI solutions that could help preserve his voice as the disease progressed. 
Collaborating with the nonprofit Bridging Voice and ElevenLabs, they aimed to recreate Ben's voice using samples from his time as a podcast host.
We used over 200 podcast episodes to create a professional AI clone of Ben’s voice that mirrored his original tone and clarity. This new voice debuted to much acclaim, allowing Ben to continue hosting his podcast with a voice his audience knows and loves.
To hear the difference, listen to this episode of Airline Confidential before Ben cloned his voice: 
And the episode that aired after Ben turned to ElevenLabs: 
The feedback from the listeners has been overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing support for Ben's continued presence in the podcast. Importantly, Ben’s AI voice lets him not only maintain his professional roles but also enhances his daily interactions, giving him a tool to express himself authentically despite ALS.
Ben shared his excitement with our team, writing,_"Words can't express how thrilled I am with the voice clone you created for me. I've been telling everyone about this and shouting ElevenLabs' praises from the rooftops!"_
Ben's story is another testament to the power of technology to profoundly contribute to people’s accessibility needs and wellbeing. His optimism and determination, coupled with innovative AI solutions, have allowed him to face his challenges head-on, continuing to lead a fulfilling life that inspires others.

November 29th, 2024, Global - Bertelsmann, a leading media, services and education company based in Europe, has partnered with ElevenLabs to use AI in creating new stories and experiences across its brands. This collaboration aims to make production faster and more accessible throughout Bertelsmann’s portfolio.
“With Bertelsmann’s Tech & Data Alliance, and its recently founded AI Hub, we have been at the forefront of applying new technologies across our businesses and building partnerships to accelerate the adoption of GenAI solutions in our businesses. ElevenLabs’ sophisticated AI solutions are cutting-edge, ensuring high quality and multi-language audio experiences,” says Rhys Nölke, Chief Data Officer, Bertelsmann.
ElevenLabs will provide advanced AI tools, including lifelike voice and sound generation, as well as a forthcoming music model, to support production and pre-production. The AI products will help Bertelsmann’s teams streamline, reach wider audiences, enhance employee workflows and test new creative directions.

Currently, 36 companies within the Bertelsmann Group use ElevenLabs’ technology, gaining improved production timelines and broader creative possibilities. The partnership reflects a shared goal: using AI to help creators do what they do best, not to replace them.

Whether you're creating stand-out YouTube videos that captivate your audience or memorable corporate videos that impress your clients, [sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) can be the difference between a mediocre video and one that retains the viewer's attention.
Yet, gone are the days when great sound effects require dedicated actors, an expensive recording studio, and a myriad of props. Now, the latest AI technology means that content creators can easily generate audio files and sound effects that fit any circumstance, using artificial intelligence to manufacture sound at the touch of a button.
But what actually are sound effects, and what is the purpose of including them in today's content? How can AI tools help with generating sound effects, and what are the best tools to use?
In this article, we'll delve into sound effects, taking a look at the history of this unique sound generation and its uses. Then, we'll compare the leading AI sound effect generators available in 2024 and discuss how you can start including innovative sound effects in your next piece of video or auditory content.
## What are sound effects?
Sound effects, sometimes known as sound FX, are **artificially created or enhanced sounds** used to emphasize or add realism to storytelling in diverse media, for example, movies, television shows, computer games, and theater productions.
[Sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) are so ubiqitous, you'll probably don't notice them in your favorite movie. They are incredibly diverse and include background noises, the sound of vehicle crashes, the chatter of a crowd, applause, the gentle trickle of a stream - whatever you can think of.
The purpose of this kind of sound in content creation, film-making, and storytelling is to enrich the narrative by providing auditory cues that complement visual images or recordings. They can be realistic (i.e., a real sound of something) or musical (i.e., background music that complements the storyline).
Ultimately, sound has an important role to play in how we humans interpret and understand stories. We all know and recognize the happy jingle of a popular advertisement, the tension from the Jaws background music, or even the inspirational swell of applause, and our bodies and minds react to these sounds in different ways.
As a result, sound FX can enhance your storytelling, delight your audience, and entertain your listeners. They're an important part of professional video and podcast creation and play a critical role in engaging an audience and effectively sharing a narrative.
## The history of sound effect generation
But sound hasn't always been a part of the narrative scene. In fact, in the old movies, sound was unable to be recorded, 
When sound recordings in films became more freely available during the 20th century, realistic sounds in a movie or on the radio started to become important. 
Foley artists used a range of everyday items to create the sounds of events happening on-screen or over the radiowaves. This could include a shoe and a wooden board for creepy footsteps, water bowls for the sound of splashing, and balloons popping for the sound of gunshots. This type of sound effect creation required precise human interaction and creativity, a silent audio recording studio, and expert equipment.
During the 21st century, sound effects have become ubiquitous and are expected in every type of film, movie, video content, advertisement, and even podcast. A modern movie audience is unlikely to watch a movie in silence, and grandiose sound effects, even on YouTube videos and in TikTik shorts, are increasingly common.
Research has given movie-makers and content creators the power to use sound effects for psychological purposes and an immersive experience, for instance, with background sounds that are unsettling to the listener or sounds that lull us into a false sense of security. [Sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) can even be used to move action on, close the screen, show an audience when to laugh or cry, and even be the punchline to a joke.
Although Foley artists still exist for big-budget productions, sound effects can be bought from a sound FX library or generated using AI technology. The reduced costs and wide availability of sound FX means that even amateur content can make use of professional effects and realistic noises to add the next level of immersion and entertainment to their content.
## Can AI generate sound effects?
So, can AI really generate realistic, widely available, and unique sound effects? The answer is  _yes_.
Generative AI has taken the world by storm in the past few years, resulting in incredible breakthroughs in softwares that produce incredible visual image generation, text generation, and even [voice generation](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/what-is-text-to-speech/). Audio sounds and music, however, have been a little harder.
This is because AI struggled to comprehend the variety of noise. Ideas of melody, rhythm, genres, and creativity are difficult for computer models to replicate, which has held AI audio generation back in comparison to large-language models such as ChatGPT.
But 2023 marked a breakthrough, with hyper-realistic voice cloning software like [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) bursting onto the scene, bringing easy-to-use software that generates voice, sound, and speech with incredible degrees of accuracy. Already in 2024, excellent sound effect generators, like ElevenLabs' own generator, are making sure the power of realistic, professional-quality sound FX is available to everyone.
And now, you can generate sound effects from a text prompt. Check out some of these examples:
  * [Gun Sound Effect](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects/gun)
  * [Alarm Sound Effect](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects/alarm-clock)
  * [DJ Scratch Sound Effect](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects/dj-scratch)
  * [Phone Ringing Sound Effect](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects/phone-ringing)
  * [Clock Sound Effect](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects/clock)
  * [Camera Sound Effect](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects/camera)
## Why use sound effects in your content?
If you're a content creator, podcast speaker, or YouTuber, you might be questioning whether sound effects are important for you after all. Perhaps you've been getting by with a voice recording and a few musical jingles and have already built up your audience.
The reality is, sound effects add a professional, polished feel to your content. In today's media-centric society, your audience is likely already primed to expect FX features and content lacking them will seem amateurish and unprofessional.
Plus, a sound effect can play an important role in content, marking the change of scene, an end to a narration, prompting an emotional response, or building suspense. It's important for content creators to adjust their content to meet these expectations, build a loyal following, and create quality content that their audience engages with.

Not to be one left behind by a technological innovation, Meta announced in August 2023 the release and emergence of AudioCraft, a free generative AI tool for music generation and sound effects. AudioCraft features three distinct models, each with a specific function:
**MusicGen:** By using music owned by Meta or specifically licensed, MusicGen transforms text prompts into musical pieces. Input just a few lines of text, and MusicGen can generate a full composition.
**AudioGen:** Trained on a wide range of publicly available sound effects, AudioGen is capable of generating realistic sounds from text descriptions, such as the whistle of the wind or the sound of knocking on a wooden door.
**EnCodec:** This model represents the latest advancement in decoding technology, with cutting-edge, new features that allow for the generation of high-quality music in a range of HZ with reduced artifacts.
Collectively, the three AI models in AudioCraft provide creators with the tools to play with new musical compositions, enhance videos with soundtracks and sound FX, and create new pieces of audio from text. The problem with AudioCraft? It's not very easy to install, run, or use. It's designed for those tech experts already comfortable with coding and complex AI systems, and it doesn't have a user-friendly interface like ElevenLabs.
While Meta has hopped on the bandwagon of generative AI with AudioCraft, it doesn't feel like the software is yet user-ready. It's certainly a great choice for coders and developers looking to adapt AudioCraft and make it their own, but it's a complex tool, and amateur video creators, experimenters, and busy video editors will find it unwieldy and complex.
Finally on our list is Plugger.ai, an easy-to-use sound effect generator available online. Plugger.ai is a tool that works and looks similar to ChatGPT and can create text output, AI-generated images, and sound effects.
While the interface appears straightforward, there are few reviews and examples available online to help you understand the quality of Plugger output. Hidden behind a $19/month subscription for the Lite package, which includes 100 'tasks' per month (the generation of one image, text output, or one audio file constitutes a single task), Plugger.ai isn't cheap in comparison to others.
For a higher quality output and lower monthly costs, the best choice remains ElevenLabs.
## Final thoughts
The generation of AI sound is in its infancy. AI tools have traditionally struggled to replicate the wide variety and subtleties of music, sound FX, and background noise, and it's only now that industry leaders, like ElevenLabs, are generating reliable-quality output for professional use. The latest software available shows this progression.
From the high-fidelity realism of ElevenLabs to the advanced capabilities of AudioCraft, each software offers unique features that suit a range of uses. Whether you're a professional sound engineer seeking support in movie production or a content creator looking to enhance your videos and build an audience, this selection of AI tools will revolutionize the way you create videos, offering unique sound FX and outstanding realism.

  * **No saving preferences:** The model won’t remember your input between projects, meaning you have to take the time to re-enter information about your game each time the model is used
  * **Unsuitable effects:** Because the software depends on accurate user input, the system can make errors, generating effects that don’t align with their intended use
### Pricing
Unlimited SFX isn’t yet available for paid use. To request early access, prospective users can join the waitlist on Discord.
### 5. AudioGen AI from Meta
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fh9jvy4koc1-56zprpy1906&w=3840&q=95)
AudioGen AI is the new sound effect generation tool from social media giant Meta. Similar to their MusicGen tool, which generates music samples based on text descriptions, 
  * **Free options:** Users will be able to generate 100 free sound effects per month, which is more generous than other free trials. However, these generations will be classed as ‘low priority’
  * **No software download:** The model runs entirely online, so doesn’t take up valuable storage space 
  * **Open source:** The model’s source code is freely available, allowing possibilities for redistribution and modifications

## How to choose an AI SFX generator
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fl9afg7327p-DALL%C3%82%C2%B7E%202024-08-09%2014.54.16%20-%20An%20image%20representing%20an%20AI-powered%20sound%20generator.%20The%20scene%20features%20a%20futuristic%2C%20sleek%20digital%20interface%20with%20controls%20and%20sound%20waves%20that%20are%20d.webp&w=3840&q=95)
Selecting the best AI sound effect generator for your game depends on your key priorities. While indie developers might prioritize a more experimental cost-effective solution, a larger developer will want a tried-and-tested tool that can fit seamlessly into an existing workflow. Here, explore the different attributes of AI sound effect generators to consider when choosing your ideal AI tool.
### Quality & compatibility
Different models offer varying degrees of audio quality and compatibility. It’s important to make sure the sound effects will be a perfect fit for the visual content of your game.
### Price
Some AI sound generators are completely free, and others are unfortunately not. The AI sfx generators currently on the market are subscription-based, running from $4 to upwards of $99/month.
### Specialization
Depending on the tool you use, the effects you generate for your video game may not have the parameters for customization you had hoped for. Without the ability to fine-tune and adapt effects, the soundtrack might be repetitive and seem underbaked.
### Effectiveness
Because of the fledgling nature of these AI tools, many of them still often produce inaccurate responses to input. It’s therefore worth doing your research on existing users’ experience of each software to ensure it won’t waste your time.
### Input scope
Some models for sound generation rely on short, sharp commands, while others respond to more descriptive text. In an exciting development, 
### Royalties & copyright considerations
It is important to check that the software you choose is [royalty-free sfx](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) and that the copyright will belong to the user, especially if you’re creating highly specialized sounds. Check that small print!
### Limits
Consider what you need from your AI sound effect generator. If you only need simple, common sounds, there are plenty of effective options out there. However, if you’re looking for more creative control, for instance for generating entirely new sounds for a fantasy world, you might need to invest in something more specialized.
## Final thoughts
Embracing AI Text-to-Sound tools revolutionizes content creation. In the rapidly evolving realm of video game development, AI-driven sound effect generators are a developer’s not-so-secret weapon, enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of audio engineering.
Our research shows that platforms like ElevenLabs are at the forefront, offering unprecedented flexibility.

## Overview
Conversational AI is blurring the lines between human interaction and robotic responses, one savvy agent at a time. Whether you’re familiar with the term or are just learning about this technology through this article, there’s no denying that the applications of conversational AI are growing exponentially each year. 
## What are conversational AI agents? 
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fkc1nafuhrxg-DALL%C3%82%C2%B7E%202024-10-24%2010.26.08%20-%20An%20artistic%20representation%20of%20Apple's%20Siri%2C%20set%20in%20a%20sleek%2C%20modern%20digital%20environment.%20The%20image%20features%20a%20glowing%20orb%20or%20wave-like%20design%20to%20symbol.webp&w=3840&q=95)
As far-fetched as the term “conversational AI” may sound, conversational AI agents are everywhere. 
Think Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant, and even ChatGPT. These are all mainstream examples of conversational AI, yet most people don’t realize how prominent this technology has become in their everyday lives. 
But what are [conversational AI agents](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/all-about-conversational-ai-agents) at their core?
Without delving into highly technical definitions, conversational AI agents can be considered ultra-sophisticated versions of ordinary chatbots or virtual assistants. 
While your standardized chatbot or assistant can respond to basic questions or requests, conversational AI agents go above and beyond to understand your intent and process natural language to provide human-like responses or take specific actions. 
Although conversational AI is not a new technology per se, it’s certainly advanced over the last few years alongside overall developments in artificial intelligence, leading to AI agents becoming increasingly more human-like and intelligent. 
## Applications of conversational AI agents 
When we said conversational AI agents are everywhere, we weren’t exaggerating. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, the capabilities of AI agents also grow and diversify. 
That said, let’s take a closer look at some widespread use cases of conversational AI: 
### Customer support 
While the traditional customer service bot is not well-equipped to handle questions or complaints beyond the bare minimum, conversational AI agents can understand the intent behind specific queries and respond accordingly. 
Conversational AI can help large companies and small businesses streamline their customer support processes without hiring a whole team of agents to handle complaints. If a case is too complex to solve, the agent can simply pass the ticket to a human agent and continue working on incoming tickets as required. 
To personalize AI-powered customer support even further, companies can integrate natural-sounding [text to speech software](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) into their customer support applications for a completely authentic experience. 
### eCommerce and retail
Conversational AI agents can act as personalized shopping assistants, helping customers with product searches and providing product recommendations. They are quick to figure out individual preferences, analyzing each interaction and click to provide shoppers with personalized shopping experiences based on the information gathered and processed. 
AI agents can also perform routine tasks like managing orders, modifying purchases, initiating returns, reminding customers about abandoned shopping carts, and other tasks usually left to customer service representatives. You can even implement conversational AI to encourage customers to participate in seasonal offers or make the most of sales and discounts. 
### Healthcare
You may be surprised to learn that conversational AI is also being implemented in healthcare as we speak. 
Conversational AI agents can perform a wide range of tasks in the health and wellness sphere, including helping patients schedule appointments, answering questions related to medications or treatments, and even helping patients figure out their symptoms and suggest the best course of action. 
Depending on the level of sophistication, some agents can also provide mental health support and share useful tips on managing stress and anxiety.
### Banking and finance 
Financial management can be complicated and stressful, especially for customers opening their first bank accounts, taking out their first loan, or dealing with unexpected changes to their online banking systems. 
This is where AI agents can assist with all sorts of tasks, from basic requests like checking a balance to more complex processes like guiding a customer through the stages of applying for a loan. 
In addition, conversational AI is well-equipped to detect unusual activity, alert customers in real-time, and suggest the best course of action. 
### Human resources and recruitment
Conversational AI agents can assist businesses in more ways than one, with HR and recruitment being a key sphere in which they excel. From candidate screening to employee onboarding, conversational AI can assist with day-to-day HR management processes and interact with employees on behalf of HR agents. They can also answer common questions regarding employee benefits, vacation time, and payroll information. 
These assistive capabilities allow the HR team to focus on the larger picture, including fostering a healthy work environment and developing valuable policies for employees and the company. 
### Travel and hospitality
Working in travel and hospitality is not easy, given how many things can go wrong—canceled flights, hotel booking mishaps, and other common errors. To make things easier for service workers and travelers, conversational AI agents can be implemented to assist with routine tasks like booking and reservation assistance while also helping customers by providing real-time flight and accommodation information. 
In addition, hotels can use conversational AI in the form of chatbots or voice assistants to provide travelers with helpful information regarding room service, hotel policies, taxi services, and even local attractions. 
### Education 
From personalized tutoring sessions to administrative support, conversational AI agents are being actively implemented in education and e-learning as we speak. Virtual learning assistants and AI tutors can help students catch up on homework or improve in certain subjects, preventing them from falling behind. Likewise, AI agents can also perform routine administrative tasks like assisting students in registering for courses, tracking assignments, and managing schedules. 
The result? Students are better supported, and teachers can refine their skills and focus on providing the best learning experience.
### Gaming and entertainment 
One sphere of conversational AI that has massive potential is undoubtedly entertainment. Not only can AI agents be used to make personalized recommendations to viewers and content consumers, but they can also make gaming experiences more interactive.
Conversational AI can be integrated into video games to create interactive characters, ranging from NPCs (non-playable characters) with intelligent dialogue to AI-driven game masters in role-playing games. 
Game developers can further enhance gameplay by integrating [natural-sounding text to speech tools](https://elevenlabs.io/use-cases/gaming), making characters sound increasingly more human-like as time progresses. However, it’s essential to choose a text to speech tool with realistic output like ElevenLabs; otherwise, your characters will end up sounding artificial and robotic. 
## Final thoughts 
We’re only beginning to uncover conversational AI's full potential, yet it’s already reshaping the way we work, travel, interact with others, complete routine tasks, and spend our time off. 
Conversational AI agents are becoming increasingly present in all spheres of our lives, including customer service and support, eCommerce, healthcare, finance, travel, education, and even entertainment. 
It’s safe to say that, in time, conversational AI agents will be assisting us across most professions and industries. Given how rapidly artificial intelligence is advancing, anything is possible. 
For now, go ahead and thank your virtual assistant for helping you manage your daily tasks—it’s working harder than you may believe.

## What to look for when selecting a voice generator for video games
Picking the right AI voice generator for your game isn't just about getting any voice out there—it's about finding the voice that brings your game to life. Here’s what matters.
### Voice quality
Top of the list is how real those voices sound. You want your players to feel like they're interacting with real characters, not robots. So, aim for generators known for lifelike speech.
### Versatility
Your game world is diverse. Your voice generator should be too. It needs to nail every pitch, tone, and accent to fit your game's unique characters and settings.
### Ease of integration
The best tools fit seamlessly into your workflow. Make sure the voice generator plays nicely with your game engine and doesn’t add unnecessary hurdles.
### Flexibility and affordability
Budget's always a thing, more so for indie devs. Look for flexible pricing that doesn’t skimp on quality.
### Support and docs
Good tech needs good backup. Ensure there's solid support and clear docs to smooth out any bumps.
## Final thoughts: The best voice generators for your game
AI voice generators are seriously shaking up game development, making it quicker and easier to create lifelike in-game voices in multiple languages. These tools are already incredibly realistic—and they're only getting better by the day.

# Learning chess aloud
May 24, 2024 • 3 minutes reading time
Chess.com gives their virtual chess teacher a voice
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fa3okvav9hmq-chess-desktop.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F5nz3p874j5p-ches2.png&w=3840&q=95)
Chess has captivated players around the world for over 1,000 years, a testament to its enduring appeal and strategic depth. Founded in 2007, Chess.com is dedicated to serving this large and dynamic community. The team continually explores new ways for players of all levels to engage with the game, offering innovative tools for playing, connecting, and learning online. 
Last year, a user of one of Chess.com's top learning apps, Learn Chess with Dr. Wolf, left a review: "Is there a way to get Dr. Wolf to talk through the lessons? My 7-year-old is struggling to read his commentary." Dr. Wolf, an interactive virtual chess teacher, adapts to the user's ability and helps them improve by talking through each move.
At the time, Dr. Wolf only provided text commentary without an audio component. The team recognized the potential to greatly improve the learning experience with a voice, but they knew the wrong audio component would severely detract from the learning experience. 
**Partnering with ElevenLabs**
Finding the right voice for Dr. Wolf was crucial to connect with a wide range of players and skill levels. It required finding a voice that was both authoritative and warm to maintain the personal touch of a seasoned chess coach. After sampling several voices from ElevenLabs' library, the team found one that was just what they needed. Soon after, they integrated the voice using ElevenLabs' API.
The response from users has been overwhelmingly positive. They have noted that the ideas seem to sink in more when they're able to keep their eyes actively engaged on the chessboard, and the game feels much more natural when all you have to do is listen. 
“The introduction of a voice for Dr. Wolf has transformed our app”, said Gabe Jacobs, the product manager on the Dr. Wolf team. “It's not just a feature—it’s brought a whole new dimension to learning chess online.” 
By bringing together educational expertise and ElevenLabs’ technology, the Dr. Wolf team found a new way to provide personalized, engaging 1:1 chess tutoring to players around the world. We look forward to continuing our work and exploring new ways to inspire and educate chess enthusiasts around the world.

In 1988, Benjamin Bloom, an educational psychologist at the University of Chicago, wrote an essay purporting tutorials as "the best learning conditions we can devise." Tutors, Bloom claimed, could raise student achievement by two full standard deviations—or, in statistical parlance, two "sigmas"—essentially going from the 50th percentile to the 98th. 
For forty years, education technology has chased a seemingly impossible goal: matching the effectiveness of one-on-one tutoring at scale. While the potential impact was clear, the economics never worked, until now.
While human tutors typically cost $30-50 per hour, [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) solutions can deliver comparable outcomes at $3-5, a 90% lower cost. This order of magnitude cost reduction represents the potential to transform personalized education from a luxury good into reach for the mass-market.
But the most profound insights aren't about cost savings—they're about how voice is revealing counterintuitive truths about focus, engagement, and assessment that could reshape education entirely. Early implementations by companies like 
## Uninterrupted focus: how voice enables deeper immersion
When Chess.com [added](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/chess-dot-com) a voice to their Dr. Wolf instructor, they expected the primary benefit would be accessibility. Instead, they discovered that voice enabled a fundamentally deeper level of focus for learners.
With voice guidance, students could keep their eyes locked on the board and their fingers on the pieces, fully immersing themselves in the spatial and strategic dimensions of the game. "Voice is not just a feature—it's brought a whole new dimension to learning chess online," explains Gabe Jacobs, the product manager for Dr. Wolf. 
By freeing students from the need to constantly shift their visual attention, voice allowed them to stay in a state of uninterrupted concentration. With work underway to add conversational ability to the app, it's a new age for the game of kings.
The need for students to split visual focus may be a hidden tax on digital learning—one that voice can eliminate. When students can stay visually focused on the primary learning material, whether chessboard or calculus, they can engage more deeply and grasp concepts more intuitively. 
Voice becomes a way to maintain immersion while still receiving guidance, enabling a kind of ambient support that enhances understanding rather than disrupting it.
## Interruptibility: turning passive consumption into active inquiry
Coursology's experience takes this insight even further, showing how interruption, when implemented intentionally, can transform learning. Coursology, which started as an AI homework helper, grew from zero to 50,000 users in its first month by helping students understand course materials more effectively. With its newest feature, Coursology users can interrupt AI-generated podcasts with questions, turning passive content consumption into active exploration.
"The aha moment is when students realize they can upload their most impenetrable course materials and engage in a dialogue with speakers who know everything about those topics," explains founder Colby Schmidt. Rather than breaking focus, the ability to spontaneously interrogate the material enables students to learn more deeply and efficiently.
This feature reveals a counterintuitive truth about engagement: the ability to interrupt without losing momentum may be more important than delivering flawless, linear content. The natural back-and-forth of questions and answers keeps students engaged with the material itself, not just plodding along a predetermined lesson plan.
At one-tenth the cost of human tutoring, AI allows this kind of dynamic interaction to be scaled to millions of students. The implications are profound: with tools like Coursology, the availability of on-demand personalized tutoring will grow by an order of magnitude in the coming years. Coursology itself is about to tip one million users.
## Assessment: from teaching to insight generation
SchoolAI's evolution reveals yet another unexpected opportunity. One feature allows students to learn through conversation: high school history students can speak with figures like Abraham Lincoln or Amelia Earhart, for example. What started as a platform for interactive conversations evolved into something more fundamental: a powerful tool for understanding how learning happens.
By capturing data on where students struggle, what helps them break through, and how their understanding develops, SchoolAI gives teachers unprecedented visibility into their students' learning journeys. "We're not replacing teachers—we're giving them Ironman suits," explains CTO Cahlan Sharp. "We're saving them over 10 hours a week on assessment, so they can focus on actually teaching."
![SchoolAI Cleopatra](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fbrurub7w0v-cleopatra_schoolai.webp&w=3840&q=95)
This points to perhaps the most exciting potential of voice AI in education: the ability to surface actionable insights about the learning process itself. Every voice interaction becomes a data point, illuminating patterns and interventions that would be impossible to discern at scale otherwise. In this sense, the real value of AI may lie not in the teaching, but in the metaknowledge it generates about teaching.
## What these patterns tell us about learning
These early implementations don't just suggest incremental improvements—they reveal fundamental truths about how people learn. Each discovery challenges our basic assumptions about education.
First, visual attention is more precious than we imagined. Traditional digital learning often forces students to context-switch between reading instructions, watching demonstrations, and practicing skills. This isn't just inconvenient—it's cognitively expensive. Voice liberates visual attention, allowing students to focus entirely on understanding what's in front of them.
Second, the ability to interrupt without losing context might be more important than perfect instruction. The natural flow of questions and answers maintains engagement better than even the most polished linear content. At one-tenth the cost of human tutoring, companies can now scale this kind of dynamic interaction to millions of students.
Third, the real value of AI in education might not be in the teaching itself, but in what it reveals about how learning happens. Every interaction creates data about where students struggle, what helps them break through, and how understanding develops. SchoolAI's evolution shows how this insight alone can transform education—giving teachers unprecedented visibility into their students' learning journeys.
## From insights to the future of learning
For builders exploring conversational AI, these early signals suggest opportunities to not just optimize existing educational practices, but to reimagine them entirely:
  1. Rethinking immersion: Rather than treating voice as just another interface, consider how it could enable deeper, more focused engagement with primary learning materials. How might you design experiences that capitalize on the full visual immersion that voice allows?
  2. Designing for interruption: Instead of trying to perfect content delivery, consider how you might facilitate more natural, inquisitive interaction. How could you enable students to steer their own learning, to follow their curiosity without breaking momentum?
  3. Capturing metaknowledge: Look for opportunities to surface insights not just about what students are learning, but how they're learning. How might you leverage voice data to illuminate the structures of cognition and comprehension?
The shift that voice represents in education may be as profound as the transition from scheduled broadcast to on-demand streaming in entertainment. Just as platforms like Netflix enabled fundamentally new kinds of storytelling, conversational AI could enable entirely new modes of learning. "The shift in education over the next decade will be from memorizing things to actually retaining knowledge," notes Schmidt. This isn't just speculation—it's already happening.
When Chess.com lets students maintain complete visual focus on the board, when Coursology enables interruption without disruption, when SchoolAI gives teachers unprecedented insight into how their students learn—these aren't just features. They're early signals of how voice AI could reshape education entirely.
![Conversational Voice AI 2024 Chart](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fh9ep5otgzgw-ConversationalVoiceAI2024.webp&w=3840&q=95)
In our own data, we’ve seen EdTech lead the charge in conversational AI usage since February 2024. Alongside sales and support, EdTech use cases continue to appear, complementing existing features and inspiring new ones.
For product teams, this represents more than just a feature opportunity. It's a chance to fundamentally rethink how technology can enhance learning. The economics tell one story: AI tutoring at one-tenth the cost means personalized learning could finally reach everyone. But the more profound opportunity lies in what these early implementations reveal: that conversational AI might be the key to unlocking deeper understanding. 
The companies that will define this era will be those that see voice not just as a medium for delivering content, but as an unprecedented window into how we learn—insights that will shape the lives and livelihoods of generations to come.

Convin is a complete contact center software platform offering agent training, ticketing, insights, and real-time agent assist — and now AI calling via ElevenLabs.
The company set out to solve a simple yet complex problem: how to make AI-powered phone conversations feel natural. Traditional voice agents often sound robotic, lack emotional nuance, and struggle to keep customers engaged.
With ElevenLabs’ [text to speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech), Convin’s
Integration was seamless and “smooth as butter”. Thanks to ElevenLabs’ [flexible API](https://elevenlabs.io/api) and responsive support, deployment was quick and hassle-free.
Callers were pleasantly surprised by the natural, engaging quality of the voice agent — not because they were misled, but because the experience felt smooth, responsive, and natural. 
00:00 / 00:48
Many noted, “Wait… that wasn’t a real person?” or “I just spoke to a bot for three minutes without realising!” These responses highlight how AI, when done right, can foster conversations that feel intuitive and effortless, creating trust and enhancing customer interactions rather than replacing human connection.
“These are some of the jaw-dropping reactions we’ve heard while showcasing our Voicebot, " explains Vaibhav Gupta from Convin’s Founders’ Office. “And this was possible because ElevenLabs helped us generate voices that sound human-like, making AI-driven conversations feel incredibly natural.”
The impact speaks for itself. Convin's AI voice agents, powered by ElevenLabs, are driving a 27% increase in CSAT. This is a clear sign that natural-sounding AI can drive real results.
Convin’s voice agents quickly gained traction by offering human-like engagement combined with the efficiency of AI. With ElevenLabs, every conversation feels authentic, setting a new standard for customer interaction.

# Cornell lecturer creates an AI-powered teaching assistant

## Making AI education accessible and engaging
Lutz’s courses feature over 100 hours of AI content and one of its key differentiators is the innovative use of an AI agent named S.A.I. (Sentient AI).
S.A.I is an AI teaching assistant, interacting with Lutz and turning potentially dry content into memorable interactions. For example, in one exchange, S.A.I. says, "I think," to which Lutz quips, "I don't think you think, I think you just have weights"—a playful nod to the inner workings of AI models.
When creating S.A.I., Lutz wanted to use Kenneth Cukier’s voice. Kenneth is a leading tech writer with a confident, smooth voice, and someone who Lutz knows personally. It was the perfect match. 
Excited by the project, Kenneth offered to be paid just $1—but ever the technologist, Lutz decided to pay him $404 (a nod to the famous "Not Found" HTTP error code).
## Overcoming scheduling conflicts
To save Kenneth time, Lutz attempted to make the voice [clone](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) on Kenneth’s behalf, only to be blocked by our [voiceCAPTCHA](https://elevenlabs.io/safety) security mechanism. Once they found time with Kenneth to confirm his consent on our site they were ready to start creating the content. 
The team at eCornell worked extensively to perfect the pronunciations. Initially, Lutz created scripts and recorded in-studio, responding to real-time ElevenLabs generations. Later iterations refined the voice in post-production.
To test the result, Lutz sent recordings of S.A.I to Kenneth’s wife and asked if that was him. She replied by saying she knew it wasn’t, but not because of the voice. The only ‘tell’? He used phrases he’d never normally say. 
## Expanding the horizons of online education
The success of Lutz’s course demonstrates how AI audio can enhance educational content and provide better outcomes for learners. S.A.I adds a fun twist to the courses. Students don’t just learn how AI operates in theory—they get to see it in action. S.A.I brings the content to life in front of their eyes. 
We’re thrilled to see AI Audio being used to make educational content more accessible. By making content available in any language and voice, educators can reach more students and keep them engaged.

Whether it be the crash of thunder, the soft patter of rain, or a 'HA!' from a virtual audience, [sound effects ](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects)have become a staple of content creator videos. Adding a new level of entertainment and creativity, you can't scroll for more than five minutes without hearing the signature Ru Paul's Drag Race 'rattlesnake' drama noise or 'bruh' from the iconic Vine of the same name.
While many of the most popular sound effects have their roots in popular culture (like movies and TV) as well as meme culture and gaming, other sound effects might go unnoticed. That atmospheric weather sound, the sound of applause—all are so ubiquitous that they've become simply a part of our video landscape.
If you're a creator looking to take the next step in your video creation, using sound effects is a fantastic way to do so. While you could, of course, purchase expensive sound effects from a music library or harness the use of royalty-free templates, the best way to enjoy sound effects is by using the magic of AI.
A great AI sound effect generator will create unique sounds from text prompts with just the click of a button, adding the next level to your videos and turning them from amateur pieces to excellently-produced pieces of content. In this blog, we'll dive into what sound effects are used for in media content and how to create them for yourself using the latest AI tools.
## What are sound effects used for?
[Sound effects ](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects)improve the overall quality of your video or audio by adding interesting and quirky nuances to an otherwise one-note affair. Think applause following a particularly salient point or the side-splitting sound of laughter after an excellent joke. 
You could even add in a drum roll, a scream, or a horror-inducing beat. Whatever it is, with generative AI, you can create and develop sounds that convey exactly what you need to create the next viral sensation. But what is the purpose of spending time adding these effects?
### Expressing emotion
Firstly, AI-generated sounds help you express happiness, disbelief, hilarity, or even fear with your audio or video – there's a sound effect for every conceivable emotion. Describe the moment in greater oral detail and encourage the emotion you want your viewers or listeners to feel with the right sound effect (such as a raucous round of applause). 
Is something super cute happening on screen, like otters holding hands? An emphatic "aww" would work well here. How about a sad scene in an animation? Perhaps a light melody would suit.
The reactive sound effects don't always have to be positive, either. Express shock and horror with sounds like a door slamming or opening to build suspense or even creepy noises like creaking and nails on a chalkboard to immerse your audience.
### Reacting with flair
Another powerful use of sound effects is to dramatize a reaction to an event on screen. Adding a sound effect as a funny aside to your narration will add impact to a particularly great clip. 
Emphasize your message and enhance the audio for your audience, whether that message is "this is the funniest thing you've ever seen and I want to drive that home with the best sound effect I can find" or "this is how I'd like the audience to react, so I'm going to insert the relevant sound effect to encourage them to feel a certain way."
Ultimately, sound effects can heighten your audience's reaction to what they see before them. Cracking a joke or introducing a sad, emotive moment can be signaled with the correct sound.
### Explore sound effects as editing tools
Beyond the usual, side effects can also be used to help your viewer follow the narration.
One way of doing this is by using sounds to split up clips or as a sign of moving on to the next part. For example, a sound effect that includes speech, such as "and now for something completely different" (referencing comedy geniuses Monty Python) could be applied along with extra background sound effects to make it your own. 
Other creators make use of a 'swish' sound when their scene changes location or another form of sound to indicate that a scene is coming to an end. In this way, the sound effect acts as a subtle guide for your audience to follow the plot.
### Creativity with no limits
Sound effects aren't just for vlogs or reaction videos; they have plenty of other creative uses too. 
Musicians have always found inspiration in everyday noises for their music - just look at Pink Floyd! 
Take inspiration from the music greats and include your own sound effects to emphasize a point, create a beat, create a unique soundtrack, or more.
## How to create AI sound effects
Traditionally, sound FX would be made by a Foley artist or sound designers using physical tools such as sticks, pinecones, car doors, and more to create the sounds of cracking knuckles, flapping wings, and more. 
These days, Foley artists still play a huge part in post-production for films, but for YouTubers, social media content creators, and more, AI has become the go-to for sound effects.
Foley actors, while pioneers of film, music, and stage, are often expensive. Each actor requires a large day fee, and the best sound is always recorded in a state-of-the-art recording studio — another expensive addition. 
AI sound effects, on the other hand, can be generated for low costs and in record time. The best AI sound effect generators only need a few seconds to generate precisely the effect you had in mind and can even be created from a short text prompt. This makes AI sound effects the best choice for YouTubers, TikTok creators, small businesses, and more.
Check out some examples of AI Sound Effects here:

## ElevenLabs: AI text-to-speech for your YouTube videos
It's not just [sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) that AI tools can help content creators with. AI voice overs are another big opportunity to enhance and experiment with niche sounds and voices.
For YouTubers, TikTokers, and more, AI voices are a great way to expand the kind of content on offer, translate videos into multiple languages, and generate audio content that keeps the creator anonymous. TikTokers will already be familiar with the in-built text-to-speech functionality in the app, but what about when it comes to generating voiceovers for YouTube, in-house business videos, and more?
That's where [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) comes in - the world's most advanced text-to-speech software. ElevenLabs works by blending advanced artificial intelligence (AI) with the ability to inject emotional nuances. Its biggest advantage? How the hyper-realistic voices work to generate short- and long-form content, plus the incredible ability to fine-tune voice outputs to harmonize clarity, stability, expressiveness, and utility. 
Put simply, ElevenLabs TTS always delivers speech that's **incredibly human-like** , and indeed, is often mistaken as such.
That's where ElevenLabs excels in adding the finishing touch to video and auditory content. In just a few clicks and a few minutes, content creators can take a script and turn it into an exceptionally crisp, professional-sounding voiceover in multiple languages.
## Final thoughts
The human mind responds intuitively to sound, which is why content that makes use of creative, unique, and varied sound effects is always memorable and engaging. 
In the past, sound effects were expensive, requiring months of expensive planning and recording to supplement a piece of film or movie. Nowadays, sound effects are free and widely available for every type of creator to harness, meaning that creating professional-level videos is easier than ever.
With open-sourcing trained AI software capable of giving you the data and sound algorithms you need to create sound effects that pack a punch on any device, all you need to do simply generate, download, and play.
Create your own free sound effects using [**ElevenLabs Free Sound Effects Generator**](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects).

More than 70,000 conversations have taken place with Salvador Dalí — decades after his death — thanks to ElevenLabs' voice cloning technology.

[Voice Cloning](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning)
The Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, opened in 1982 to celebrate the life and art of legendary surrealist Salvador Dalí. The collection features over 2,400 pieces, including paintings, illustrations, sculptures, books, and photographs. 
The Museum was founded with works collected by A. Reynolds and Eleanor Morse, devoted patrons and friends of Dalí. Over 40 years, their private collection grew into the largest of his works in the U.S. Today, the Museum’s curators continue to expand its exhibits. 
Now, thanks to an AI-powered installation called [ElevenLabs AI Voice](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) and [Voice Cloning](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) technology, allowing visitors to engage in conversation with Dalí via a reproduction of his famous lobster phone. 
Visitors can ask questions and receive responses in the voice and style of the artist. 
## AI Meets Surrealism 
The exhibit blends advanced voice technology with an interactive, surrealist interface. Since its launch, _Ask Dalí_ has recorded over 75,000 conversations, with topics ranging from art and history to contemporary events and personal musings. 
Martin Pagh Ludvigsen, a project lead at GS&P, explained the inspiration behind Dalí’s Voice: “The original idea was to create a guide that people could use while walking through the museum. That turned out to be a bit too complicated, so we focused on a Q&A chat with Dalí at a single location.” 
Using the lobster phone as the medium reflects Dalí’s fascination — and love-hate relationship — with telephones. He created four color versions and six off-white models of the famous surrealist object, one of which is proudly displayed in the Museum. 
## The Museum’s Commitment to Innovation 
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fl7d6ye8t6id-DSCF0919%20\(1\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
The nonprofit Dalí Museum has a strong history of embracing technology. Alongside regular VR experiences, it runs 
## How Dalí’s Voice Works 
Dalí’s Voice is powered by ElevenLabs’ [Eleven Multilingual V2 text-to-speech model](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech), alongside OpenAI’s GPT-4, which handles conversational responses. The AI voice was trained on samples from Dalí’s interviews, writings, and speech patterns to create a digital persona as true to the artist as possible. 
### A sample of Dali's voice from the SXSW demo
00:00 / 01:03
This understanding is paired with ElevenLabs’ low-latency audio processing, enabling instant, realistic voice responses. The AI models continue to learn and refine interactions over time, enhancing engagement. 
Martin Pagh Ludvigsen described how the idea came together: “Two of our creative team members came across a demo of ElevenLabs’ voice model in a customer service call. That sparked an idea — why not create a conversational exhibit where people could talk to Dalí?” 
## Overcoming Language Barriers 
One challenge was that Dalí’s first languages were Catalan, Spanish, and French. However, ElevenLabs’ multilingual capabilities allowed the team to train the model in English while preserving Dalí’s distinctive speech patterns. 
Interestingly, when Dalí’s AI speaks Spanish, it does so with a Catalan accent, reflecting his authentic speech style. So far, visitors have responded positively to this attention to detail. The team found that they were able to get closer to the Catalan accent when training the voice model on examples of Dalí speaking in English , over Spanish. 
## Training the Digital Dalí

Automate video voiceovers, ad reads, podcasts, and more, in your own voice
Training Dalí’s voice required an iterative process. The team ran multiple versions of the model, refining the output until they achieved the closest possible match. 
Another challenge was ensuring that Dalí’s personality was faithfully recreated. As Beth Harrison of The Dalí Museum explained: “Our goal was to bring Dalí to life in his Museum. We needed his digital persona to feel as real as possible.” 
To achieve this, the team crafted a detailed prompt for GPT-4 based on Dalí’s recorded speech and writings, ensuring that the voice not only sounded like Dalí but also responded like him. 
The AI’s first real test came at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, where a pre-launch demo was presented. Though the system was still in development, the voice accuracy and Dalí’s surrealist responses impressed audiences. 
## Unexpected Surrealism 
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fbd4ky5a3wbe-A%20graphic%20with%20a%20large%20number%20_75%2C000_%20in%20the%20mid%C3%A2%C2%A6.webp&w=3840&q=95)
One of the most surprising outcomes of the project has been the spontaneity in Dalí’s responses. 
Beth Harrison shared: “Some responses are so surreal that only Dalí could have come up with them. We’ve even seen him answer a question with another question — almost like he’s deliberately engaging in conversation.” 
This wasn’t programmed into the AI but emerged naturally from its design. 
## Privacy and User Experience 
The exhibit is designed with privacy in mind. Visitors ask questions via the telephone one at a time, and while responses are recorded, public questions are not stored. 
Additionally, there’s no sign-up process, making the experience seamless and intimate. The tactile feel of the telephone handset enhances engagement, reinforcing the illusion of speaking directly with Dalí. 
## What’s Next? 
The team is already exploring future installations, pushing the boundaries of technology and creativity to bring Dalí's visionary world to life in new and unexpected ways.

In April 2023, Della Larsen learned she had ALS, a progressive illness that would gradually take away her ability to speak. With her voice slipping away, Della felt an urgent need to find a way to connect with her future grandchildren—a generation she may never meet but already held close to her heart.
Turning to voice banking technology, Della set out to record herself reading 30 children’s books, preserving her voice for her family. Each book now has a QR code linking to a private recording, allowing her future grandchildren to hear her read as if she were right there with them.
Della’s journey has extended beyond her own family. On

We used recordings of Ed’s voice from before the injury to create a custom voice clone that captured his natural cadence and tone. By early August, we were ready. _“Hearing your voice again when you thought it was gone,”_ Ed shared, _“it felt like a part of me was restored.”_ And getting this part of his personal identity back let him connect with his students on familiar terms again _._

In August, Ed shared his story with a business information systems class at TCU. He played the progression of his voice: his current speech, a robotic-sounding [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) output, and finally the AI-cloned voice that matched how he used to sound. Watch his story below:
Ed’s new voice lets him teach with the confidence that his students can focus on what he says. _“If not for finding this, I don’t know where I’d be today,”_ he shared. For us, Ed’s story shows what voice AI can make possible: helping people communicate in ways that feel natural and true to who they are.

# Introducing Eleven Multilingual v1: Our New Speech Synthesis Model
Apr 27, 2023 • 5 minutes reading time
Our current deep learning approach leverages more data, more computational power, and novel techniques to deliver our most advanced speech synthesis model
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fk9vproy2lt-Introducing%20Eleven%20Multilingual%20v1_%20Our%20New%20Speech%20Synthesis%20Model.webp&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fk9vproy2lt-Introducing%20Eleven%20Multilingual%20v1_%20Our%20New%20Speech%20Synthesis%20Model.webp&w=3840&q=95)

  * [Democratization of voice](https://elevenlabs.io/#4-democratization-of-voice)
Today, we’re thrilled to launch Eleven Multilingual v1 - our advanced speech synthesis model supporting seven new languages: **French** , **German** , **Hindi** , **Italian** , **Polish** , **Portuguese,** and **Spanish**. Building on top of the research that powered Eleven Monolingual v1, our current deep learning approach leverages more data, more computational power, and novel techniques inside an increasingly sophisticated model, capable of understanding textual nuances and delivering an emotionally rich performance. This advancement expands the creative horizons for creators, game developers, and publishers, and it paves the way for using generative media to create more localized, accessible, and imaginative content.
The new model is available across all subscription plans and you can try it out now on our Beta platform.
[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
To use it, simply select it from the newly-added drop-down menu within the Speech Synthesis panel.
### Research Overview
Similarly to its predecessor, the new model is based entirely on our in-house research. It retains all the strengths that made **Eleven Monolingual v1** an excellent storytelling tool, such as the ability to adjust delivery based on context and to convey intent and emotions hyper-realistically. These features have now been expanded to newly supported languages through multilingual data training.
A noteworthy feature of the model is its capacity to identify multilingual text and articulate it appropriately. You can now **generate speech in multiple languages using a single prompt** while maintaining each speaker's unique voice characteristics. For the best results, we recommend providing a single language prompt. Although the model can already perform reasonably well with multiple languages at once, further enhancements are needed.
**The new model is compatible with other VoiceLab** features i.e. Instant Voice Cloning and Voice Design. All created voices are expected to maintain most of their original speech characteristics across all languages, including their original accent.
**This being said, the model has known limitations** : numbers, acronyms, and foreign words sometimes default to English when prompted in a different language. For instance, the number "11", or the word “radio”, typed in a Spanish prompt may be pronounced as they would be in English. We recommend spelling out acronyms and numbers in the target language as we work on improvements.
### Democratization of voice
ElevenLabs was started with the dream of making all content universally accessible in any language and in any voice. Our team members come from all across Europe, Asia and the US. As our team and the world become increasingly multilingual, we’re ever more united behind the vision of making human-quality AI voices available in every language.
The latest iteration of our [Text-to-Speech (TTS)](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) model is just the initial stepping stone on our path to making this vision a reality. With the advent of human-quality AI voices, users and businesses can now craft and customize audio content according to their needs, priorities and preferences. This has already shown the potential to level the playing field for creators, small businesses, and independent artists. By harnessing the power of AI audio, users can now develop high-quality auditory experiences that rival those produced by larger organizations with more resources.
Those benefits now extend to multilingual, multicultural and educational applications by empowering users, companies, and institutions to produce authentic audio that resonates with a broader audience. By providing an extensive range of voices, accents, and languages, AI helps bridge cultural gaps and promotes global understanding. At Eleven, we believe this newfound accessibility ultimately fosters greater creativity, innovation, and diversity.
**Content creators** who seek to engage with diverse audiences
**Game developers** and **publishers** can create immersive, localized experiences for international audiences, transcending language barriers and connecting with players and listeners to maximize engagement and efficiency, at no loss to quality or accuracy.
**Educational institutions** now have the means to produce audio content for various users in their target languages, bolstering language comprehension and even pronunciation skills, as well as catering to different teaching styles and learning needs.
**Accessibility institutes** can now further empower people with visual impairments or learning difficulties by providing them with means to easily convert less accessible resources to a medium that suits their needs, both in content and form.
We can’t wait to see our current and future creators and developers push the limits of what’s possible!

We’re excited to partner with 
Discover Daily is available on all podcast platforms and listeners can now enjoy a daily selection of curated knowledge in audio form, making it easier to engage with the material on-the-go.

### About Perplexity
Perplexity is the fastest and most accurate way to search the web. With access to real-time data across the internet, Perplexity curates relevant sources (from academic research to Reddit threads) and creates answers far better than a list of sponsored and SEO-optimized links on a traditional search engine. Unlike other AI offerings, Perplexity must include in-line citations for every source it uses in the response. This means trusted answers and the ability to fact-check.

Today we launched ElevenLabs G.K., an international subsidiary based in Tokyo, Japan. Our new Japanese entity will focus on adapting ElevenLabs' cutting-edge voice generation platform for the Japanese market while addressing the unique linguistic and cultural requirements of the region. 
#### About ElevenLabs Japan
Company Name: ElevenLabs Japan G.K.
Location: 1-6-5 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan
General Manager: Hajime Jim Tamura has over 35 years of experience helping companies enhance performance through business applications. A pioneer in Japan’s cloud computing landscape since the late 2000s, he has consistently led the advancement of operational efficiency through SaaS solutions.
His past roles include Vice President of Marketing at SAP Japan, President of NetSuite Japan, Director of Business Applications at Microsoft Japan, and General Manager of Asana Japan. After serving as COO of the virtual office platform ovice, he assumed his current role at ElevenLabs Japan in 2025.
#### Ongoing Strategic Partnership in Asia Pacific
While we're just now announcing ElevenLabs G.K., we've already got to work in Japan, partnering with:
- DOCOMO Innovations, Inc.: A Silicon Valley-based R&D subsidiary of NTT DOCOMO, Inc., Japan’s largest mobile operator.
- TBS: One of Japan’s leading private broadcasters, engaged in a wide range of television, radio, and content production.
- MBC C&I CO., LTD: A subsidiary of MBC, one of Korea's leading broadcasters, focusing on programme production and media business development.
- LLSOLLU: A South Korean technology company with proprietary translation and localization technologies. 
They are integrating ElevenLabs' dubbing with their proprietary translation technology to provide more customer-specific dubbing services to their clients. For example, TBS is also leveraging ElevenLabs’ dubbing to make their KASSO program available in multiple languages for international viewers.
Furthermore, MBC C&I CO., LTD has been using ElevenLabs' TTS and SFX technology to create commercial AI video content. In particular, “Mateo”, produced by the AI Content Lab under MBC C&I, won the Grand Prize at the Korea International AI Film Festival, and “Art In the World” won first place in the Narrative category, demonstrating the potential of AI-powered storytelling provided by ElevenLabs.
#### Strategic Expansion into Japan
"Japan represents a critical market for ElevenLabs' international expansion strategy," said Carles Reina, VP of Revenue at ElevenLabs. "We chose Japan as our first international subsidiary because of its rich linguistic heritage, technological innovation, and the potential impact our technology can have on bridging communication gaps and preserving cultural narratives."
ElevenLabs G.K. will be led by Hajime Jim Tamura, who brings extensive experience in the Japanese AI and technology sectors at Asana and Microsoft. 
"The Japanese market presents unique opportunities for voice AI technology that go beyond traditional applications," said Jim Tamura, Head of ElevenLabs Japan. "From enhancing accessibility services for an aging population to enabling more immersive entertainment experiences, we see tremendous potential to address domestic needs through our platform. Our voice synthesis technology's ability to preserve natural intonation and emotional nuance is particularly valuable in Japanese, where pitch accent and contextual subtleties carry significant meaning."
#### Linguistic and Phonetic Advantages
From enhancing accessibility for an aging population to creating immersive entertainment experiences available in multiple languages, our platform is well-positioned to meet the country's diverse needs. 
In Japanese conversation and reading, subtle nuances of pitch, accent, and context carry significant meaning. That's why speech synthesis technology capable of expressing natural intonation and delicate emotions will be incredibly valuable in this market.
#### Investor Support
The establishment of ElevenLabs G.K. has received strong support from the company's investment partners, who see Japan as a strategic market for AI voice technology.
Voice is quickly becoming a core interface for how we interact with technology, and ElevenLabs is at the forefront of enabling high-quality, scalable voice AI. Their platform delivers lifelike, emotionally expressive output that is particularly well-suited for the Japanese language. As businesses globally adopt innovative AI tools, Japan stands out as a dynamic market leading that charge. We’re proud to support ElevenLabs as they expand their presence and bring powerful voice capabilities to industries across Japan.
Jennifer Li, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz
We’ve had the privilege of working closely with the ElevenLabs team in Japan over the last several months, and we couldn’t be more excited about their expanded presence in the market. ElevenLab’s leading audio and voice platform is rapidly transforming industries all over the globe, and we’ve already seen strong interest in their offerings from Japanese enterprises in our corporate network. We look forward to continuing to support their growth in the market.
Todd Grover, Partner at World Innovation Lab (WiL)
ElevenLabs’s technology, which enables the generation of human-like, natural-sounding speech, has the potential to significantly enhance customer experiences across sectors such as entertainment and customer support. We are confident that it represents a new frontier in generative AI applications.
With an eye toward future use cases involving the Japanese language, the NTT DOCOMO Group’s R&D division (DOCOMO Innovations, Inc.) is currently conducting technical evaluations in preparation for a full-scale launch in the Japanese market.
We have strong confidence that ElevenLabs’s solution will seamlessly address the varied needs of industries and users throughout Japan.

# ElevenLabs joins Disney’s accelerator program
Feb 22, 2024 • 1 minute reading time
The Walt Disney Company announced that ElevenLabs is among the 2024 Disney Accelerator companies.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F6fx5nz6cia2-ElevenLabs%20joins%20Disney%C3%A2s%20accelerator%20program.png&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F89e69c44dwu-disney2.png&w=3840&q=95)
The Walt Disney Company announced that ElevenLabs is among the 2024 Disney Accelerator companies.
Disney is one of the world's most globally recognizable brands and has held a special place in our hearts since childhood. 
Mati Staniszewski, CEO of ElevenLabs, adds: 
“Being part of a programme like this with Disney is a dream come true. I’m a huge fan of all of their content but I don’t think it gets better than the movie Up. It was a pleasure to watch it when it first got released, and then re-watch it as a young adult only to realize the key messages still resonated so strongly. That’s part of the magic of Disney; creating characters and worlds that stay relevant and universal. And I’m excited to explore how we can play a part in making this true across even more languages. I truly look forward to cultivating relationships with teams across The Walt Disney Company.”
This type of unprecedented access to the creativity and imagination of Disney will be instrumental in our mission of breaking down language and communication barriers.

**2023-06-20, London / New York** - ElevenLabs, a voice technology research company and world leader in audio AI software, has raised a $19m Series A to continue its voice AI research and product deployment - part of its mission to make all content universally accessible. 
**ElevenLabs unveiled its Beta platform in January 2023,** after spending 2022 developing audio AI models that could create the most versatile and contextually-aware AI voices. Since launch, ElevenLabs has amassed **over 1 million registered users** who have**over 10 years worth of audio content.**
ElevenLabs tools can turn any text into speech using synthetic voices, cloned voices, or by creating entirely new artificial voices that can be tailored according to gender, age, and accent preferences. Through its research, ElevenLabs has been able to achieve a new level of speech quality that is almost indistinguishable from a real human with sub-1 second latency. 
Their platform has already been embraced across multiple creative verticals and sectors, from independent authors creating audiobooks, developers voicing characters in video games, supporting the visually impaired to access online written content, and powering the world’s first AI radio channel. ElevenLabs has also launched a range of B2B partnerships, including with one of the world largest audiobook publishers **Storytel,** leading global content creator platform **TheSoul Publishing,** incredible game developers like **Embark Studios** and **Paradox Interactive,** and the creative media platform**MNTN.**
ElevenLabs is announcing today that it has raised a **$19m Series A round co-led by****,****, and****,** with further participation from 
This investment will be used to continue building ElevenLabs' cutting-edge research hub for Voice AI and to launch a range of additional products to support specific market verticals such as publishing, gaming, entertainment, and conversational applications. 
**Mati Staniszewski, CEO and co-founder of ElevenLabs, comments:**  
_“Over the last five months, we’ve seen our technology embraced by millions of creators, companies, and curious minds. We are right at the beginning of this journey and now with Nat, Daniel, and Andreessen Horowitz joining, we have the best partners as we continue on the ambitious path forward.”_
**Piotr Dabkowski, CTO and co-founder of ElevenLabs, adds:**  
_“Since our inception in April 2022 we have focused on assembling a great team - one of the key factors for long-term success - and have built a unique team of talented, passionate and hard working people. With such a wonderful set of colleagues and partners, we are well on our way to realizing our ambition of completely breaking down language barriers with technology.”_
The company is taking an integrated approach to developing voice AI research and products. In response to user demand, ElevenLabs is also announcing [_**Studio**_](https://elevenlabs.io/studio) - a highly sought-after production workflow for editing and creating dynamic, long-form spoken content.
_Studio_ will give content creators, such as publishers and independent authors, access to a hitherto unavailable level of control over their AI-generated audio content. It builds on the company’s research into long-form speech synthesis and audio ‘infilling’ to provide users with the ability to **seamlessly** **generate entire dialogue segments, news articles, and even audiobooks without leaving the platform.**_Studio_ aims to provide a ‘Google Docs’ level of simplicity and user-friendliness to audio creation. 
[_Studio_](https://elevenlabs.io/studio) joins the ElevenLabs suite of products, which includes _Speech Synthesis_ , a [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) platform that leverages pre-existing synthetic voices and _VoiceLab_ , a workflow for creating a unique voice or digital version of an existing one. The platform has also recently released access to _Eleven Multilingual_ - a speech synthesis model, which can be used across major European languages. The platform is available for all at: [elevenlabs.io](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/). 
These recent product developments are stepping stones towards developing an AI dubbing tool aimed for release later this year. This will enable any video to be dubbed into any language in an engaging, effective, and scalable way, all while maintaining the original speaker’s voice. The company is already conducting a number of tests with industry partners to enable AI dubbing at scale. 
**ElevenLabs is also unveiling its** _**AI Speech Classifier**_**.** This tool will
**Mati Staniszewski adds:**  
_"Our mission is to be the ultimate tool for storytelling, dissolving language barriers and putting all audiences in the reach of all content creators in a safe and responsible way. With an incredible, growing team and these exceptional investors, ElevenLabs is now ever closer to realizing its long-term goal of making all content universally accessible in any language and in any voice.”_
**About ElevenLabs:**  
Established in 2022, ElevenLabs is a voice technology research company developing world-leading text-to-speech software for publishers and creators. Our mission is to make content universally accessible.

# ElevenLabs Raises $2M and Announces AI Speech Platform Promising to Revolutionize Audio Storytelling
Jan 23, 2023 • 5 minutes reading time
The company opens access to Beta platform designed to let creators and publishers narrate long-form content
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=%2Fplaceholder-16x9.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=%2Fplaceholder-1x1.jpg&w=3840&q=95)
  * ElevenLabs launches Beta platform allowing creators and publishers to narrate their long-form content
  * The pre-seed funding round was led by Credo Ventures, with Concept Ventures and individual investors also participating
  * Capital will fuel research and development of the AI dubbing aimed for release later this year
**2023-01-23, London, UK |** ElevenLabs, an AI voice technology startup, is building lifelike speech synthesis tools with the long-term goal of instantly converting spoken audio between languages. Today, they announced launching their Beta platform after raising $2 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Credo Ventures, with Concept Ventures and other individual investors also participating.
[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
The company’s platform lets creators and publishers narrate long-form content and expand into the audio format. Its features are powered by an in-house developed deep learning model for speech synthesis which realistically renders human intonation and inflections, and can adjust delivery based on context. ElevenLabs also offers a suite of tools for voice cloning and designing synthetic voices, aimed at providing users with new creative outlets. The company is currently working with selected publishers on a dedicated workstation for voiceover editing which will be added to the platform in early February. ElevenLabs seeks to become the first AI narrator providing the quality necessary for voicing news and audiobooks at scale.
Leaps in capability require innovation, which is why ElevenLabs considers itself first and foremost a research company. Much of this research to date focused on developing new [text-to-speech models](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) which rely on high compression and context understanding to render human speech ultra-realistically. The company also built a new model for voice cloning which achieves high output similarity with no training (no fine-tuning), on samples as short as 5 seconds - a feat previously unheard of. Developers can access all these features via API.
This research powers the platform’s current features but it also contributes to realizing the company’s ultimate goal of instantly converting spoken audio between languages. Their AI dubbing tool, aimed for release later this year, will let users automatically re-voice any audio or video in a different language, all while preserving the original speaker's voice. ElevenLabs initially hopes to attract clients in the education arena, while its long-term goal is to make on-demand multilingual audio support a reality across streaming, audiobooks, gaming, movies, and even real-time conversation.
The company’s speech synthesis and dubbing tools are as complementary as they are well-timed: both promise to bring audio and video to wider audiences and both come at a time when the audio space is booming. An early group of testers, among them YouTube creators, publishers and developers, already use the platform daily to voice videos, stories and characters, and the company expects the sphere of potential applications for generative speech will only expand. News publishers have already found that growing their audio presence is a great way of engaging and retaining subscribers. But contracting voice actors is expensive, as is having reporters read their stories. Book and newsletter authors, and even game developers, face similar challenges: the former increasingly turn to narrating their own work and the latter need to decide whether a particular character justifies recording costs. Those who use existing text-to-speech software save money but pay a different price by compromising on quality. ElevenLabs insists there is no longer a need to compromise as they prepare to equip creators and publishers with the most advanced and versatile AI storytelling tools.
_“The platform we’re launching now is all about turning text into top-quality spoken audio. We want to let people enjoy their favorite book or newsletter by giving a voice to all the authors, creators and developers who couldn’t afford one”_ - says Mati Staniszewski, a co-founder._“Our ultimate goal is to let people enjoy any content they find relevant and interesting, regardless of what language they speak” -_ adds Piotr Dabkowski, also a co-founder.
_At Credo Ventures we seek to work with smart and ambitious founders from the CEE region. We saw the hunger and spark in Mati’s and Piotr’s eyes at our very first meeting. A few months later they’re becoming an OpenAI-grade speech technology research hub overcoming the biggest challenges in artificial audio. Their synthesized voices are already indistinguishable from real ones and this breakthrough has not only massively lowered the barriers to generating content in unprecedented quality and fidelity, but soon enough it will also let creators radically expand their audiences by going multilingual._ – says Maciek Gnutek, General Partner at Credo Ventures.
_Despite being commonplace across entertainment & business alike, audio has been relatively neglected by recent advancements in research. We couldn't be more excited to be backing Mati & Piotr during this golden era for generative AI, and believe ElevenLabs are the team to bring this technology to the masses, one voice at a time_ - says Oliver Kicks, Principal at Concept Ventures.

## Introduction to ElevenLabs and Bland.ai
Conversational AI orchestration platforms, like ElevenLabs and Bland.ai, enable developers to create customizable voice agents. These voice agents now [handle customer support calls](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/building-an-agent-for-our-own-docs), train[ 911 dispatchers](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/ai-voices-helping-train-911-dispatchers), and power [new journalistic experiences](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/time-brings-conversational-ai-to-journalism). 
Most platforms combine speech to text (STT), a large language model (LLM), and [text to speech (TTS)](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech), along with built-in turn-taking and interruption handling, to support natural, human-like conversations. Many companies, like Bland.ai, partner with other organizations to provide each of these components externally and handle the orchestration of the various external processes. This has significant drawbacks in terms of reliability and latency. 
In contrast, ElevenLabs is both a research and product company that creates foundational audio models and offers a packaged solution. This integrated approach allows ElevenLabs to optimize latency by eliminating the need for multiple server calls, providing users with the highest quality TTS and STT in-house, as well as ensuring better reliability.

## Bridging the gap in healthcare communication
If you’ve called to schedule a doctor’s appointment recently, you have felt the pain of being stuck on hold and having to navigate complex phone trees. Health professionals want to spend their time providing in person support to their patients - not on the phone. 
EliseAI is automating non-clinical tasks in healthcare so that doctors and patients don’t need to make tradeoffs. In partnership with ElevenLabs, EliseAI has successfully deployed AI voice agents across multiple healthcare verticals, lowering barriers to care across the U.S. EliseAI's assistants can reliably conduct domain-specific conversations with technical expertise - from appointment scheduling to billing and payment processing.
![EliseAI Explainer](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F0ux717r2f38-eliseai_explainer.webp&w=3840&q=95)
### The power of natural conversation
One of the biggest concerns EliseAI heard when getting started was that AI voices would not sound natural and patients would reject AI scheduling. They came to us in search of natural human-like voices that people would want to talk to. The end result is a system so natural that only 15% of callers realize they're interacting with an AI agent. And of those who do realize, 95% continue through with the call, satisfied that they are able to get 24/7 immediate access to support. 
Tessya Federico, Director of Partnerships at EliseAI said:
> Our partnership with ElevenLabs has been transformative. Their voice technology has allowed us to create AI agents that not only sound natural but can also communicate fluently in multiple languages. This has been a game-changer for healthcare providers and patients in diverse communities.
### Example scheduling call with EliseAI
00:00 / 00:24
### Multilingual support for diverse communities
One of the most significant impacts of EliseAI's implementation has been in making healthcare more accessible to non-English speakers, particularly in the Southern United States. Spanish speakers who previously struggled to make appointments, can now do so in their native language. EliseAI currently has agents in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Hindi, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Indonesian, Filipino, Japanese, Ukrainian, Greek, Czech, Bulgarian, and Classic Arabic with plans to expand to 10 other languages. 
The implementation of EliseAI's voice agents, powered by ElevenLabs, has led to remarkable improvements in enhancing healthcare administration and efficiency:
- A 66% reduction in cost per call
- 88% of calls fully handled by AI agents
And overall has significantly improved patient outcomes and increased accessibility in healthcare, specifically in rural areas while maintaining security and reliability in the process
As EliseAI continues to refine its technology and expand its reach, the potential for AI-driven improvements in healthcare administration is boundless. With ElevenLabs' voice technology at its core, EliseAI is not just streamlining processes – it's reshaping the future of healthcare communication, creating a more patient-centric ecosystem.

## Overview
For conversational AI to feel natural, responses need to be instant. Delays break the rhythm, making interactions feel robotic and frustrating. By optimizing TTS pipelines, developers can significantly reduce response times and improve user experience. 
## Why quick response times are non-negotiable for conversational AI agents
As technology advances, user expectations also increase in proportion. One of the differentiating factors between great and mediocre [conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is the ability to produce instant responses without sacrificing quality. 
When there is a noticeable delay between a user’s input and the AI’s spoken response, the interaction becomes awkward and unnatural. This issue is especially problematic for virtual assistants, customer service bots, real-time translation applications, and other tools expected to provide instant responses. 
Fortunately, an optimized [text to speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) pipeline ensures that AI-generated speech is processed and delivered quickly. Developers can significantly improve AI responsiveness by identifying common latency bottlenecks and applying the right strategies.
In this guide, we explore key factors affecting TTS latency in conversational AI and best practices to speed up response times. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear grasp of how to optimize your conversational AI agent and ensure your users don’t have to wait around for responses.
## Key factors slowing down speech output in conversational AI
Reducing latency requires an understanding of the technical components that contribute to delays in AI-generated speech. Several factors can slow down TTS processing, from model complexity to network constraints. Addressing these issues will help you create a model that responds faster, reducing frustration among users.
### Model complexity and inference speed
Larger and more advanced TTS models tend to produce higher-quality speech, but they also require more processing power. For example, neural network-based TTS models like Tacotron and WaveNet generate realistic speech but can introduce delays due to the high computational demand.
Some applications, such as [voice assistants](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/the-future-of-voice-assistants-in-conversational-ai), require rapid responses. To achieve this, developers often use optimized versions of these models or distill them into smaller, more efficient variants. 
Companies like Google and Microsoft have successfully implemented model quantization techniques to reduce computational overhead without sacrificing voice quality.
### Audio streaming vs. full synthesis
One way to reduce latency is to stream audio as it is generated rather than waiting for the entire speech output to be processed before playback. Streaming TTS enables real-time conversations by ensuring that users hear responses immediately, even if the whole sentence has yet to be synthesized.
For instance, call center AI solutions use streaming TTS to handle customer inquiries as soon as they receive them. By generating and delivering speech as it processes, these systems prevent awkward silences that can frustrate customers.
### Preloading and caching
Preloading frequently used phrases or caching common responses is another effective technical hack for reducing processing time. 
In customer service applications, AI chatbots often rely on standard responses for frequently asked questions. Instead of regenerating speech every time, these responses can be pre-synthesized and instantly played when needed.
A practical example is voice navigation systems, where phrases such as "Turn left in 500 meters" or "You have arrived at your destination" are preloaded to provide an immediate response. This approach is simple to implement and prevents unnecessary delays.
### Edge computing and local inference
Many AI-driven applications rely on cloud-based TTS solutions. However, sending requests to a remote server and waiting for a response can introduce latency. Edge computing addresses this issue by processing TTS locally on the user’s device, eliminating the need for constant cloud communication.
Voice assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have adopted hybrid models that process simple requests on-device while outsourcing complex queries to cloud servers. This approach helps maintain responsiveness while relying on the cloud’s computing power when needed.
### Network and API response times
Network latency is a significant factor in response time for cloud-based TTS solutions. The speed at which the AI receives and processes a request depends on server location, API efficiency, and network congestion.
Reducing latency involves optimizing API calls, using low-latency server regions, and employing faster data transfer methods such as WebSockets instead of traditional HTTP requests. These optimizations help ensure that AI-powered speech remains quick and natural.
## Top tips for optimizing TTS pipelines for lower latency
Enhancing the performance of a TTS pipeline can seem complex, but it’s entirely achievable with the right tools—even for smaller teams!
To make things easier, we’ve compiled a list of best practices for [developers to build faster and more responsive conversational AI systems](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/building-your-first-conversational-ai-agent-a-beginners-guide) without sacrificing output quality in the process:
### Choose the right TTS model for speed and quality
Not every application requires the most advanced TTS model. While some AI-powered platforms prioritize ultra-realistic speech, others, like automated customer support bots, may prioritize speed over voice perfection. It all depends on your use case and target audience.
For example, ElevenLabs balances high-quality voice synthesis with real-time performance, making it suitable for various use cases. Meanwhile, Google’s TTS service offers different voice models, allowing developers to choose one that best suits their performance needs.
### Implement adaptive buffering for smooth playback
Adaptive buffering allows speech output to be delivered smoothly, even under varying network conditions. By adjusting how much of the speech is preloaded before playback starts, buffering prevents awkward gaps and interruptions.
For AI-powered virtual receptionists, this technique enables speech to flow naturally, even when there are brief connectivity issues.
### Minimize latency through parallel processing
A key optimization process is running multiple tasks in parallel instead of sequentially. By simultaneously handling text preprocessing, speech synthesis, and audio rendering, AI can deliver spoken responses much faster.
This process is especially useful for industries such as finance, where real-time stock market analysis needs to be delivered within seconds. Parallel processing ensures rapid insights without delays.
### Use SSML for smarter speech synthesis
Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) allows developers to fine-tune speech characteristics, improving clarity and reducing the need for computationally expensive post-processing.
For example, an AI-powered audiobook reader can use SSML to add natural pauses and adjust pacing, replicating a human narration experience while minimizing the workload on the TTS engine.
## Final thoughts
Minimizing latency in TTS pipelines is crucial for building responsive, human-like conversational AI. Developers can reduce latency by selecting the right TTS model for their use case, implementing adaptive buffering, and using parallel processing and SSML. 
Real-world applications show that even small latency reductions make a noticeable difference, especially in use cases like AI customer service bots and real-time language translation apps. 
As AI continues to evolve, the demand for real-time speech synthesis will only grow. Developers and businesses can successfully compete in the AI agent market by prioritizing efficiency and refining the pipeline.

Recently it seems everybody is talking about generative AI. Deep learning-powered large language and text-to-image models like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E and Midjourney have caused much fuss in the tech world, and beyond. Many include them among the most significant recent developments in AI. Whether or not you agree, the general sentiment seems to be that something very all-powerful has appeared. In 2023 we’ll hear about models that can help you draw or create videos. Much like questions about what’s the latest-greatest smartphone, we’ll soon be asking about what's the latest-greatest foundation model. Yet for all this excitement, we feel there’s one area within generative media that’s still severely underhyped: voice AI. It’s also the area we seek to become leaders in. At Eleven, we rely on the potential unlocked by deep learning techniques each day to power our lifelike [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) and [voice cloning](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) tools. And now, we’re also deploying our own generative model which lets you design entirely new synthetic voices from scratch.
### Voice Generator - design a voice
Our users take to the platform daily to bring their characters alive - be it for audiobooks, games or fan fiction. We realized our current speaker bank is too small for everybody to find the voices that match their content needs while remaining exclusive to each user. Our solution was to let you design entirely new synthetic voices.
We had an idea for how we'd go about this which came as we unpacked the methods we currently use for speech synthesis and voice cloning. Both processes require a way of encoding the characteristics of a particular voice. Speaker embeddings are what carries this identity - they're a vector representation of a speaker's voice. We realized that we could sample from the distribution of speaker embeddings by training a dedicated model to let us create infinitely many new voices.
Since our users mostly look for specific speech characteristics, we needed to add a degree of control over the process. We expanded our model with conditioning to generate voices based on their characteristics. The model now lets you set certain basic parameters which establish the new voice’s core identity: gender, age, accent, pitch and speaking style. In other words, every time you hit ‘generate’, even if you choose the same base parameters, **you get a completely new voice that didn't exist before**.
Below are some examples of voices that can be designed this way:
'Design Voice' will become available on our platform this February, as part of Voice Lab.
### What's the use?
Our tools can already produce speech that's as lifelike as any human's and we expect the sphere of potential applications for artificial voices will only expand. Many of these new applications, including recording audio for news publications or commercials, will require that one voice be confined to, and identified with, a particular brand or use-case, and not be used somewhere else. Other use-cases, like storytelling and video games, prioritize flexibility and the freedom to experiment from early on in development. So rather than create a gigantic set of virtual speakers, we set out to let users have the final say on which voices best suit their purposes.
**Book** authors now gain not just the opportunity to easily convert their work to audio but they also retain artistic control over designing bespoke narration. This presents their audiences with interesting new ways of interacting with publications, as well as greatly increases the number of books we'll be able to enjoy listening to.
**News** publishers have increasingly ventured into audio and choosing distinctive voices to represent their publications is an important task - many listeners value form as well as substance. Equally importantly, publishers can now be certain that a particular voice represents them, and them alone.
**Video game** developers can now voice a plethora of otherwise mute NPCs with all the necessary tools available at their fingertips. Not only can they be more cost-effective without compromising on quality but they can now also design voices that will be entirely unique to the virtual worlds they create.
**Advertising** creatives need voiceovers to suit particular campaigns, so being able to design resonating and purpose-built narration at the start of development is a considerable advantage. They can now experiment with multiple voices and delivery styles instantly and without engaging additional resources.
From **creators** producing all kinds of audio and video content to **corporate** officers seeking to voice company communications, the opportunities for designing compelling audio that’s both unique and tailored to a specific use-case are now endless.
### Ethical AI
Similarly to how voice cloning raises fears about the consequences of its potential misuse, increasingly many people worry that the proliferation of AI technology will put professionals’ livelihoods at risk. At Eleven, we see a future in which voice actors are able to license their voices to train speech models for specific use, in exchange for fees. Clients and studios will still gladly feature professional voice talent in their projects and using AI will simply contribute to faster turnaround times and greater freedom to experiment and establish direction in early development. The technology will change how spoken audio is designed and recorded but the fact that voice actors no longer need to be physically present for every session really gives them the freedom to be involved in more projects at any one time, as well as to truly immortalize their voices.
On top of this, the reason we're excited is that a multitude of books, news, independent games and other content whose authors and developers wouldn't otherwise be able to afford recording costs will now become accessible through another medium. With this increased access comes the opportunity to widen audiences in each case. 
At Eleven, we're fully committed both to respecting intellectual property rights and to implementing safeguards against potential misuse of our technology:
  * We only partner with clients who adhere to our Terms which prohibit malicious use of our technology towards any purpose which can be deemed illegal or harmful;
  * We're also working on watermarking all audio generated by our model so that it can be instantly traced back to us;
  * When we use recognizable voices, we do so for demonstration purposes and in contexts which do not give rise to conflicts of interests;
  * At the same time we seek to support voice owners and their licensors in claiming their rights and all known infringements will be reviewed and actioned.
### Looking ahead - enhance your own voice
In the future we plan to combine the capabilities of our voice generating and voice cloning models to allow users to enhance their own voices. You’ll be able to clone your voice and then manipulate it to any desired effect. If you fear your natural speaking style is a bit monotone, you’ll be able to add variety to it. If you really dislike being recorded, you’ll be able to manipulate the output to sound more natural. Any person who needs to produce audio featuring their own voice for any purpose, be it a pre-recorded presentation or an audio message, will be able to do so using our suite of tools, at a click of a button.

Human agent or advanced robot? These days, it’s hard to tell. 
## Summary 
  * Conversational AI technology has led to the creation of highly realistic chatbots and virtual assistants.
  * These tools, also known as conversational AI agents, understand our language patterns and intents and can provide human-like responses and solutions. 
  * They rely on natural language processing, machine learning, large language models, and speech recognition to process human input and generate accurate responses, taking into account human factors and variants. 
  * Voice-activated virtual assistants can be further enhanced with AI-powered text to speech technology to produce realistic responses that sound indistinguishable from human speech. 
## Overview 
Conversational AI is taking over our corporate, educational and personal spheres, and for good reason. Unlike your standard rule-based chatbot, conversational AI agents are fully capable of processing how we speak and express ourselves to craft accurate responses and provide personalized solutions. 
## Intro to conversational AI 
Have you ever interacted with a customer service chatbot on a website only for it to completely misunderstand your question or, even worse, present you with an error message for a seemingly basic query?
If the answer is a solid “Yes,” you’re not alone. In fact, so many businesses and users were encountering similar problems that engineers had no other option but to develop something better. Something that understood natural communication and could interact with humans on an equal level. 
Enter conversational AI. 
At its core, conversational AI is a technology that enables machines to naturally interact with humans. It’s a rapidly growing subset of AI that can be used to build powerful chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational AI agents and applications. 
Ready to discover more? It’s time to dive into the transformative world of conversational AI agents. 
## What are conversational AI agents?
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F7i79e9f0s8y-DALL%C3%82%C2%B7E%202024-10-23%2012.20.19%20-%20A%20highly%20realistic%20human-like%20robot%20face%20with%20detailed%20features%2C%20blending%20human%20and%20machine%20elements.%20The%20robot%20has%20glowing%20wires%20and%20circuits%20visible.webp&w=3840&q=95)
Conversational AI agents use artificial intelligence to respond to questions or commands the way a human being would. They consider a range of factors that distinguish humans from machines, including natural language and individual communication styles, to understand user intent and provide valuable responses. 
Think of conversational AI agents as advanced, human-esque versions of standardized chatbots. 
While basic chatbots, like website customer support agents, can only address frequently asked questions or provide limited information, conversational AI agents go above and beyond to interact with users the way a trained professional would. 
How is this even possible? 
Through advanced AI technology, of course.
Conversational AI agents use a powerful combination of natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, speech recognition, and vast datasets to mimic human interactions while maintaining all the capabilities of an advanced machine. 
## The main types of conversational AI agents
Gone are the days when standardized chatbots would mess up user interactions and leave everyone complaining about “stupid robots.” 
Thanks to leaps in conversational AI, engineers are able to develop and launch conversational AI agents that put the conversational aspect into user interaction. 
Let’s take a look at some of the most common types of conversational AI agents: 
**AI-powered chatbots:** In contrast to standard chatbots, AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT 4o take it up a notch by using natural language processing to understand user intent and provide solutions outside the standard scope. While rule-based chatbots often get “stuck” on non-standard queries, AI-powered chatbots leverage a vast amount of data to respond accordingly, taking human variants into account. 
**Voice-activated virtual assistants:** Similar to AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants are trained to address various user queries, with one exception—instead of analyzing text, they analyze speech. Think Siri, Alexa, or even Google Assistant. All of these are mainstream examples of conversational AI agents. In addition to personal use, AI voice assistants are also becoming [increasingly present in education](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/ai-voice-assistants-in-education). 
**Multimodal AI agents:** While the examples listed above work with one type of input, multimodal AI agents can analyze several inputs, including text, voice, images, video, non-speech audio, gestures, and more. These types of conversational AI agents go above and beyond to help users with various queries while analyzing a range of inputs. 
## Key components of a conversational AI agent 
Conversational AI is becoming an essential component of many business operations, yet its inner workings remain a mystery to many. 
Let’s take a look at the key components of conversational AI and how they help conversational agents go above and beyond during [customer interactions](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/use-ai-in-customer-support): 
### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP allows AI agents to understand, interpret, and generate human language—one key feature that sets conversational AI agents apart from basic chatbots or assistants. NLP can be divided into two main categories: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). While NLU helps the agent understand the nature of a user’s question or prompt, NLG allows the agent to generate coherent and relevant responses. 
### Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning allows conversational AI agents to evolve and adapt as they interact with different users. Modern-day ML algorithms are excellent at analyzing patterns, preferences, and past interactions, collecting a virtual knowledge base that allows the AI agent to improve and get smarter over time. 
### Large Language Models (LLMs)
In addition to NLP, conversational AI agents rely on large language models to understand various topics, allowing them to craft better responses. LLMs are trained on extensive datasets, from books and web pages to articles and social media posts, allowing them to better process language and respond accordingly.
### Speech Recognition
Advanced speech recognition is a must for AI-powered voice assistants. Speech recognition converts spoken language into text, allowing the AI agent to process, analyze, and understand a wide range of voice commands. 
## Conversational AI agents and text to speech 
When designing and launching a conversational AI agent, it’s important to focus on the quality of the output rather than just the output itself. 
This is particularly crucial when developing AI-powered voice assistants, as you want them to respond to users in a natural and authentic way.
With advanced [text to speech tools](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) like ElevenLabs, you can develop conversational AI agents that respond to users in a human manner, eliminating the need to create a built-in TTS system from scratch.

## Final thoughts 
Conversational AI agents are blowing standardized chatbots out of the water, one innovative tool at a time. 
Powered by advanced natural language processing, complex machine learning algorithms, large language models, and speech recognition, these agents go above and beyond to understand user intent and respond in ways that consider various human factors and language. 
Engineers and AI development companies can integrate natural-sounding text-to-speech software into voice-activated virtual assistants to humanize their conversational AI agents further. 
That said, the fascinating world of conversational AI is still in its infancy. Stay tuned for more exciting updates—there will be plenty!

# Lori Cohen's AI-enabled return to law
Mar 8, 2024 • 4 minutes reading time
A Story of Resilience and Technological Breakthrough in the Legal Field
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fopi5ssl1vjb-Lori-Cohen-Stage.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fopi5ssl1vjb-Lori-Cohen-Stage.jpg&w=3840&q=95)
In March 2022, on what seemed like an ordinary morning, Lori Cohen woke up unable to speak. She tried to greet her dog Lightning and nothing came out.
As the Co-Chair of Global Litigation at Greenberg Traurig, Lori has achieved national recognition for the 58 defense records she’s won on behalf of her clients over the last thirty years. She’s known as the “Trial Wizard” for her unique combination of scientific expertise and public speaking ability. 
After almost two years since she lost her voice, doctors have yet to find the cause, let alone a cure. Although she hasn’t given up hope, losing her voice put her trial work on pause and made day to day life difficult. 
“The practice of law is a great and meaningful profession and not one to be taken for granted. Even after my thirty three years of practicing law, I truly love it and am eminently proud of being a lawyer,” Cohen said. 
“I especially love and thrive on being a trial lawyer, which is all I ever wanted to be or do growing up. It is because of these deep sentiments that I am fighting so hard to stay in this practice and to return to court and trials rather than giving up, which I have no intention of doing.”
While she hasn’t given up hope of a cure, she’s been forced to seek alternatives. In partnership with Gerard Buitrago, her colleague and longtime friend, they found Speech Assistant, a text-to-speech app. While good for short responses, it is too robotic to use in the courtroom.
When they discovered ElevenLabs, they realized they could create a replica of Lori’s voice that sounds just like her using old interviews and court presentations. That’s when AI Lori, aka Lola, came to be. By Fall 2023, Lori was back in the courtroom using Lola to argue motions on her behalf. 
Jonathan Orent, an attorney at Motley Rice who has appeared opposite Lori in several cases, had this to say: “I have litigated against Lori for years. With her new technology she has once again found her voice. She is every bit as formidable now as she was before.“
Lori and Gerard were recently awarded the Outstanding Achievement in Legal Technology by Law.com & Legaltech News. You can listen to Lori’s award speech, delivered by Lola, here: 
00:00 / 02:35
We were fortunate to learn about Lori’s inspiring story when we saw the coverage from Law.com. After meeting with Lori and Gerard, we know that there’s a lot more we can do to make our technology better for Lori and others that have lost their voice. To support day to day communication, we need lower latency & the ability to generate audio locally on a mobile device.
We’re eager to find more ways we can use our technology to support others with accessibility needs. If you work at an accessibility-focused organization that can benefit from emotive text-to-speech technology, please

Artificial Intelligence enables every audiobook listener to have personalized narration in their own language and accent.

Imagine you’ve been waiting anxiously for the sequel to your favourite book. Finally, after months, it’s here. You download the audiobook, and press play. In your head, you’d imagined the narrator with a warm, gravelly tone — maybe a hint of a posh British accent. But instead, the voice is flat, or too high-pitched, or just wrong.
With a physical book, the possibilities are unlimited: your mind shapes the characters’ voices. With traditional audiobooks, that choice is made for you. For decades, audiobooks have been limited to a single voice, dictated by publishers’ decisions, budget constraints, and the availability of narrators. But AI is changing that. Today, you don’t just have to passively listen, you can actively engage with the book in a way of your choosing.
This shift matters because the audiobook market is growing at an unprecedented rate. By 2029, the number of audiobook listeners is expected to reach 1.8 billion. Global revenue is also climbing, projected to hit $9.84 billion by the end of 2025 and surpass $13 billion by 2029.
Despite these gains, the current market figures primarily reflect traditional audiobook production, which remains limited by cost and narrator availability. We believe voice AI will accelerate this growth by reducing production barriers, making audiobooks more accessible across languages and regions, and enabling more creators to bring their stories to life. 
As demand for immersive, convenient storytelling continues to rise, AI-driven narration will help unlock the full potential of the audiobook market.

Bring any book, article, PDF, newsletter, or text to life with ultra realistic AI narration in one app
Traditional audiobooks have long been limited to a single narrator chosen by publishers — often based on budget, author input, and availability rather than listener preference. An English-language audiobook might feature an American voice, but an Australian or Indian listener may prefer a narrator with a more familiar accent.
Unlike reading a physical book — where readers naturally imagine character voices — traditional audiobooks don’t offer that flexibility. As New York Times best-selling author 
> Everybody's different. What I may like or imagine as an author might be different than what listeners may actually prefer. It’s powerful to give my listeners the flexibility to choose how they want the story told.
AI-driven narration changes this by allowing users to customize their listening experience, making audiobooks more immersive and accessible.
Beyond personal preference, AI narration removes barriers faced by authors, particularly indie writers and those from smaller markets. The cost and production time of human narration have traditionally been prohibitive, and even authors who want to narrate their own work don’t always get selected.
As USA Today best-selling author 
> For the fist time, readers are in control of how they want to hear their audiobooks. The ElevenReader app allows listeners to customise their audiobook experience and bring an author's stories to life in the most meaningful way for them.
The 
Language selection has also been a major limitation in traditional audiobook production, with most recordings limited to globally dominant languages. Even when translations exist, localized accents and dialects are rarely considered.
ElevenLabs' voice technology changes this by generating highly localized voices with contextual awareness — ensuring narration sounds natural and emotionally resonant. Our data from nearly 900,000 hours of audiobook listening shows that users strongly prefer localized voices.

Across the eight largest global languages in the ElevenLabs reader app, over 34 unique AI voices are represented, with the most popular voice in any given language accounting for just 15% of total listening.
This diversity highlights the demand for narration that feels native to each listener. Even within the same language, preferences vary widely.
Brian
00:00 / 00:03
George
00:00 / 00:06
In English, for example, Brian (American accent) is the top choice in the U.S., while George (British accent) is preferred in the UK and Australia. A similar trend appears in Portuguese — Jessica is the most popular voice in Brazil, while European Portuguese listeners prefer David.
Jessica
00:00 / 00:03
David
00:00 / 00:03
The data reveals that only one AI voice was shared among the top five in both Portugal and Brazil, despite their shared language roots. This demonstrates the importance of regional variety. While this preference for dialect seems intuitive, tone of voice is even more subjective.

A thriller set in Glasgow may sound best with a Glaswegian accent, while a Parisian love story feels more natural with a French one.
Our analysis of nearly 900,000 hours of audiobook listening confirms that no single voice fits all listeners. Even within one language, AI voices display a "long tail" of user preference — where the top narrator in a sample represents just 10% of listening, requiring more than a dozen voices to reach 50% of usage.
This reinforces a reality that traditional audiobook production simply cannot match:**listeners around the globe want a choice, and AI makes that possible.**

As audiences demand richer, more engaging content, [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is emerging as a transformative tool for entertainment and media. This technology bridges the gap between passive and interactive formats, offering new ways for consumers to connect with their favorite stories, teams, and platforms.
From interactive storytelling in gaming and film to [AI-powered assistants](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-conversational-ai-will-change-entertainment-and-media) that simplify content discovery, conversational AI is making media more accessible, immersive, and tailored to individual preferences. Industry leaders like ElevenLabs are at the forefront of these innovations, driving advancements that are reshaping how we consume, interact with, and create entertainment content.
## Redefining entertainment with Conversational AI
Over the last decade, the way we consume media at home and on the move has transformed. The advent of streaming across film, TV and music has provided us access to almost any show, track, movie or slice of news in an instant. Even the way we engage with our devices is continually in transition. We now expect a coherent, personalized response and swift action taken. 
In 2025 we anticipate that conversational AI will become increasingly built into media content itself, reshaping the way we consume and interact with our favored forms of entertainment on a daily basis. We will see a rise in interactive forms of entertainment, even in areas previously passive.
While our means of consuming media has somewhat shifted, the way we watch and listen has remained steady. Indeed, the instant accessibility of film has further enabled us to settle in to watch well worn flicks or binge-watch brand new shows whenever we want. In this regard, ‘passive consumption’ is, and likely always will be, a cornerstone of our modern routines.
As emerging technologies become increasingly familiar, though, we’re seeing the beginnings of a shift in preferences. Today, 43% of consumers prefer interactive video over traditional formats, and interactive content achieves 300% higher engagement rates than static formats.
These numbers reflect the growing preference for personalized content, control, and the kind of deeper engagement that is becoming so ubiquitous in other parts of our daily interactions with tech. Voice controlled functions within our media and entertainment setups are taken as standard nowadays, but in most cases, they facilitate discovery — and therefore the very ‘passive consumption’ that we know and love so well.
## **The evolution of interactivity in entertainment**
While our love for passive consumption remains strong, interactive media is on the rise. The Interactive Multimedia Platforms (IMP) market has 
This growth aligns with the broader expansion of the media and entertainment industry as a whole, projected to grow from $27.72 billion in 2023 to $40.36 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing integration of digital technologies and interactive formats. And as the tools and technologies that facilitate our consumption of film, television, music and art become more sophisticated — expectations for storytelling and audience engagement follow.
Interactive media is particularly resonating with younger demographics. While 55% of Gen X and older audiences still prefer passive entertainment formats such as traditional film and TV, younger generations, including Gen Z and millennials, are embracing interactive experiences. Only 
# Bandersnatch: An Ambitious Application That Came Too Soon?
The notion of conversational AI was catapulted into cultural conversation with the release of Netflix’s _Bandersnatch_ in 2018, as part of the popular _Black Mirror_ anthology.
The 90-minute film represented a bold experiment in interactive storytelling and likewise laid bare multiple facets and barriers to conversational AI becoming a commonplace addition to film and television.
The film borrowed the concept of branching narrative possibilities from gaming and allowed viewers to make decisions on behalf of the protagonist, shaping the narrative in real time. This "choose-your-own-adventure" format generated significant buzz and gave audiences a taste of uncharted interactivity on screen.
In the end, however, _Bandersnatch_ revealed both the promise and limitations of early applications of interactivity in film. While it succeeded in creating a novel viewing experience and with 94% actively engaging through choice selection, it also highlighted some challenges:
  * **Audience readiness:** Some viewers were unprepared for the level of participation required, finding the process disruptive rather than engaging.
  * **Narrative depth:** Critics noted that the branching storylines, while innovative, occasionally felt shallow, lacking the emotional resonance of traditional linear narratives.
  * **Production complexity:** With a range of possible outcomes at each step, _Bandersnatch_ ’s creators cited the difficulty of managing and delivering quality across multiple timelines.
  * **Replayability:** Unlike gaming, which thrives on replayability, film as a medium may struggle to sustain audience interest in exploring multiple outcomes.
Despite these limitations, _Bandersnatch_ was a valuable early attempt to introduce interactivity into the home viewing experience. It demonstrated the potential for audience-driven narratives while underscoring the importance of balancing interactivity with narrative depth and user experience.
## Applications in sports entertainment 
Where the application of conversational AI directly into scripted entertainment has a way to go, live sports media is seeing remarkable expansion into AI, not just in revenue but also in driving fan engagement. 
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F0sgh522tp3gd-out.webp&w=3840&q=95)
At a glance, the global AI in sports market is projected to grow from $1.03 billion in 2024 to $2.61 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 16.7%. This growth is fueled by what leading players are seeing as huge potential for tools like conversational AI to revamp and supercharge fan engagement globally. In this sense, conversational AI offers a pathway towards:
  * **Deeper engagement** : AI-powered platforms enable teams and franchises to deliver highly tailored experiences, improving fan loyalty and satisfaction
  * **Boosted sales** : Enhanced fan interactions can lead to increased ticket and merchandise sales. Already, teams using conversational AI report higher conversion rates by improving the customer journey with tools like chatbots and virtual assistants
  * **New revenue streams** : Sponsorship activation is another area seeing transformation. AI tools provide brands with direct communication channels to engage fans, delivering personalized promotions during events and increasing brand visibility
Younger audiences, in particular, are driving this demand for unique, immersive experiences. According to a 
Of course, that statistic alone is a positive sign for the survival and future security of fans attending live games, however we also believe it to be an indication of the growing penchant for unique experiences that carry the unique experience of live sport back into the home. 
We anticipate that the clubs and franchises that move to adopt conversational AI into their content strategies will supercharge engagement and boost fan loyalty at an earlier phase.
### **Ai.lonso – updates and analysis from a fan favorite**
Aston Martin’s collaboration with ElevenLabs on [_Ai.lonso_](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/ai-lonso) is a prime example of how AI can elevate fan engagement and offer practical solutions within a crowded pack. 
Embedded into the Aston Martin website, _Ai.lonso_ allows fans to receive race insights and updates in English, Spanish, or French from the two-time world champion driver and team number one, Fernando Alonso. 
Developed with ElevenLabs and DeepReel, the tool enables fans around the world to get updates in their chosen language, and is anticipated to foster affinity with the Aston Martin team beyond their regular fanbase. 
It’s a forward-looking innovation that major franchises across sports will need to consider in order to capture younger audiences earlier. Lastly, it’s one of the best examples for how conversational AI can immerse audiences in ways traditional fan engagement strategies can’t.
### FACTS: Stats on hand with ESPN’s conversational AI Avatar
ESPN’s recent announcement of AI avatar FACTS and Aston Martin’s Ai.lonso showcase new means of presenting sports data in realtime, making analytics increasingly accessible and engaging for fans. FACTS is a conversational AI avatar currently in development with launch timing to be decided, as part of TV coverage for college football show SEC Nation in the US.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fssni6z075i-GcXY_hlbUAAlkZT.webp&w=3840&q=95)
FACTS will be trialled for pre-game conversation and is designed to present data-driven insights, including the Football Power Index (FPI), player statistics, and game schedule. Built on NVIDIA’s Omniverse platform and powered by Azure OpenAI for language processing, as well as ElevenLabs for text-to-speech capabilities, FACTS is built on a solid base of AI infrastructure and will share complex sports data in a newly accessible and fun way.
##  Layering Up Fan Engagement with Real Value 
Rather than directly replacing on-air talent, **FACTS** is intended to complement human broadcasters by providing additional insights and freeing up journalists to focus on nuanced storytelling. 
> "FACTS is designed to test innovations out in the market and create an outlet for ESPN Analytics’ data to be accessible to fans in an engaging and enjoyable segment. It complements our journalists and on-air talent, providing additional insights."   
> — **Barron Miller, Coordinating Producer, SEC Network/ESPN**
### Key Benefits:
  * **Interactivity:** Fans can engage with FACTS to ask questions or explore specific statistics, making sports data more accessible and engaging.
  * **Scalability:** Unlike human presenters, FACTS can handle an unlimited number of simultaneous queries, ensuring all fans receive personalised responses.
  * **Collaboration over outright replacement:** ESPN’s approach highlights how AI can augment, rather than replace, human talent, focusing on enhancing the overall viewer experience.
While FACTS and Ai.lonso are still in their earliest phases, ESPN is exploring its potential integration into mainstream programming. This project reflects a broader trend at ESPN toward leveraging AI for innovative content delivery, including generative AI tools that create text summaries of sporting events.
Ai.lonso will soon be available in other, non-European languages — an optimization that we expect to boost global reach and marketing revenues for Aston Martin and Alonso’s own brand as an athlete.
Within the arena of sports broadcasting in both Europe and the US, rights holders are fighting to establish themselves as the authoritative voice in a crowded arena of broadcasters. 
We foresee that the application of conversational AI can add a critical edge that keeps viewers across generations engaged, and provide the personal, in-depth edge to set their coverage and analysis apart.
## Conversational AI in streaming
In an age where streaming platforms serve up a near endless ream of choice for consumption, audiences are increasingly facing a particularly modern paradox: the abundance of options often leads to frustration and disengagement. Decision fatigue, that is the cognitive overload caused by too many choices, has become a growing challenge for platforms, impacting user satisfaction and retention.
While some might shrug off the notion of decision fatigue as an example of hypermodern malaise, its scale and impact are significant.
  * **Time lost:** Users spend an average of 24 minutes weekly deciding on TV shows and 25 minutes selecting films, amounting to over 100 days across a lifetime.
  * **Abandonment rate:** 1 in 5 viewers abandon their viewing session entirely after failing to decide on content.
  * **Content overwhelm:** 33% of users report feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of options, while 49% admit they often take so long to decide that they end up watching nothing at all.
These patterns reduce satisfaction and diminish the enjoyment of streaming, directly impacting user engagement. To combat this, platforms are increasingly looking to technology for solutions.
##  CineSearch: AI-Powered Streaming Recommendations 
**Cineverse’s CineSearch** leverages conversational AI to eliminate decision fatigue. Its AI-powered assistant, Ava, transforms browsing into a streamlined, engaging experience—reducing search time, increasing engagement, and maximizing time spent watching, not searching. 
  * **Search Efficiency:** Ava cuts browsing time by tailoring recommendations to user preferences, moods, and viewing habits. With 20% of users abandoning sessions due to choice overload, CineSearch directly addresses this frustration.
  * **Personalized Engagement:** Instead of scrolling through endless options, users can ask Ava for specific recommendations like, “What’s a good comedy for a Friday night?” or “Find me something suspenseful and short.” This natural interaction fosters connection while simplifying decision-making.
  * **Enhanced User Experience:** CineSearch prioritizes user-centric design, ensuring users spend less time searching and more time enjoying content. This approach boosts satisfaction and retention, keeping audiences engaged for longer periods.
The impact of conversational AI on streaming extends beyond solving decision fatigue — it offers platforms a competitive advantage including enhancing user satisfaction by simplifying discovery. Conversational AI reduces frustration and ensures users find content that aligns with their tastes.
This has a knock-on effect of increasing retention. By offering quick, personalized recommendations the platform can minimize abandonment rates and keep users engaged. This in turn can open opportunities for premium subscriptions, targeted advertising and cross-promotions.
As services are increasingly competing for subscriber loyalty, tools like _Ava_ become key differentiators, offering tailored user experiences that stand out in a crowded market.
### The future of voice AI in streaming
Looking ahead, conversational AI in streaming has the potential to redefine the user experience even further. Imagine:
  * **Interactive extras** : AI-powered virtual assistants offering real-time trivia, behind-the-scenes insights, or interactive polls during a viewing session.
  * **Virtual meet-and-greets** : Conversational AI avatars of actors or directors engaging with fans during live premieres or Q&A sessions.
  * **AI-powered franchise revivals** : Voice assistants that extend the life of beloved characters, allowing fans to interact with them in personalised ways.
While Cineverse’s own depth of content isn’t currently competitive with the major players, we predict that similar styled personal, branded assistants will become commonplace for the likes of Netflix, Prime and Disney+.
## Conversational AI enables accessibility in journalism
Beyond streaming, [TIME Magazine’s collaboration with ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/time) demonstrates how conversational AI is pushing the boundaries of more traditional fields. By integrating AI-driven voice technology into their reporting, TIME has created a more interactive and engaging way for audiences to consume news.
The initiative introduces conversational AI voices to narrate TIME’s stories, offering listeners a personalised and immersive experience. Unlike traditional text or pre-recorded audio, conversational AI allows for dynamic interactions and interruption, adapting tone and pacing to suit listener preferences and mimic a natural interaction, and affording space for expanded learning around a topic.
  * **Enhanced accessibility:** TIME’s narrated articles make content more accessible to visually impaired readers or those who prefer audio over text.
  * **Engaging storytelling:** The use of lifelike AI voices transforms how audiences consume journalism, offering a richer, more immersive experience compared to static text or generic narration.
  * **Scalability:** Conversational AI enables TIME to quickly scale audio content creation across its vast library of articles, ensuring a consistent yet flexible user experience.
TIME’s implementation of conversational AI into their online news stories also offers a look into the way we might engage with our favorite podcasts in years to come. The format’s remarkable rise from a relatively niche format, to a booming industry valued $2.3 billion and which attracts around 464.7 million listeners globally, indicates that it won’t be long before producers are looking to innovate further in order to attract and retain new listeners.
In terms of conversational AI, we foresee a huge opportunity for innovative production houses to implement a similar form of interactivity as TIME — whereby listeners can engage with their podcast in a more conversational manner, for example, at a predetermined moment seamlessly pieced amongst the bulk of traditional, pre-recorded segments.
## **Text to speech advertising**
Further, podcasts are unique in the sense that in the traditional form, audio takes absolute priority. For many hosts, advertising is a necessary element that brings in significant revenue, but can take time away from content creation. By integrating text to speech voice AI into workflows, producers can streamline the time it takes to record and edit ads.
While hosts and talent might be skeptical of signing off on a cloned voice of theirs to engage in conversation, text-to-speech can be hugely beneficial for time-saving when it comes to recording ad segments in which the content, duration or nature of an offer might change frequently. 
### Addressing key challenges
So, the benefits of conversational AI are clear, but implementing this transformative technology in entertainment isn’t without hurdles. Businesses and studios often face several challenges, but these can be addressed with thoughtful planning and the right tools. Let’s explore these challenges and how ElevenLabs can help overcome them.
Interactive formats are growing in popularity, but traditional passive consumption remains a cornerstone of entertainment. Audience preferences vary widely depending on demographics and region:
  * **North America** : Social and location-based experiences, such as VR arcades, dominate, with 62% of users valuing interactive elements.
  * **APAC** : Home to 1.48 billion gamers, the region prioritises mobile gaming and esports, emphasising real-time interactivity and social engagement.
  * **Europe** : Immersive AR/VR attractions remain popular for their focus on storytelling.
Studios must carefully balance these preferences to avoid alienating passive viewers while appealing to younger, tech-savvy audiences who demand interactivity. Segmenting audiences effectively and tailoring strategies regionally is key. By leveraging ElevenLabs’ tools, studios can adapt their content to align with diverse audience preferences while maintaining accessibility and quality.
## The cost of interactivity
**Developing and maintaining conversational AI systems involves significant costs:**
  * **Development** : Building virtual assistants, voice cloning, or interactive characters requires advanced infrastructure and specialized expertise.
  * **Ongoing expenses** : Regular updates and optimisation ensure systems remain functional and engaging, adding long-term costs.
**Despite these expenses, the ROI potential is high:**
  * **Enhanced engagement** : Personalized interactions lead to longer engagement times and higher satisfaction.
  * **New revenue streams** : AI-enhanced franchises report increased ticket sales, merchandise purchases, and sponsorship opportunities.
  * **Innovative pricing models** : Subscription tiers or pay-per-use models for AI features can offset costs while making interactivity accessible.
Choosing a partner like ElevenLabs simplifies this process. With intuitive interfaces and scalable solutions, ElevenLabs helps reduce upfront development complexities and provides cost-effective tools for creating interactive, high-quality content.
Conversational AI also presents complex technical and ethical considerations that demand thoughtful solutions such as consent and ownership of voices. Voice cloning requires robust safeguards to prevent unauthorized use, as demonstrated by SAG-AFTRA’s consent agreements for performers’ digital likenesses.
There is also the risk of misinformation as deepfake technology could be used to distort reality. With this in mind it is important to ensure transparency and consistency to maintain trust. Similarly, it is important to ensure AI systems are trained on representative datasets that prioritize inclusivit and fair representation.
Audiences demand clear disclosures about how AI systems are developed and used. Regular audits and ethical guardrails are essential.
ElevenLabs operates with the [highest ethical standards](https://elevenlabs.io/safety), ensuring every voice cloning project adheres to strict codes of conduct. Features like watermarking, verification processes, and transparent usage policies provide studios with the tools they need to build trust with audiences. By addressing ethical challenges proactively, ElevenLabs empowers studios to innovate responsibly and confidently.
For conversational AI to thrive in entertainment, studios and developers must address these challenges proactively. With ElevenLabs as a trusted partner, they can unlock the full potential of this technology while maintaining the highest standards of integrity and inclusivity.

For most applications, latency is a mild concern. However, for conversational AI, latency is what separates good applications from great ones.
For starters, the goal of conversational AI is fairly aspirational—to provide the same feeling, touch, and voice as a human conversation, while surpassing a human in intelligence. To accomplish this, an application must converse without long silent gaps. Otherwise, the realism is shattered.
Conversational AI’s latency challenge is compounded by its piecemeal nature. Conversational AI is a series of intermediate processes, all considered state-of-the-art in their respective fields. Each of these processes incurs additive latency.
As a generative voice company, we’ve spent a long time studying how to minimize latency for conversational AI. Today, we want to share our learnings, out of hopes that they’ll be helpful for anyone interested in building conversational AI applications.
## The Four Core Components
Every conversational AI application involves at least _four_ steps: speech-to-text, turn-taking, text processing (i.e. LLMs), and [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech). While these steps are executed in-parallel, each step still contributes some latency.
Notably, conversational AI’s latency equation is unique. A lot of process latency problems can be reduced to a single bottleneck. For instance, when a website makes a database request, the web’s network latency drive the total latency, with just trivial contributions from the backend’s VPC latency. However, conversational AI’s latency components aren’t drastically varied. They are uneven, but each component’s latency contribution is within a degree of the others. Accordingly, latency is driven by a sum of parts.
### Automatic Speech Recognition
_The System’s “Ear”_
Automatic speech recognition ([ASR](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-to-text))—sometimes referred to as speech-to-text (STT)—is the process of converting spoken audio into written text.
ASR’s latency is not the time it takes to generate text, as the speech-to-text process runs in the background while the user speaks. Instead, the latency is the time between the end of the speech and the end of the text generation.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fgpibtes22su-image%20\(11\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
Accordingly, short and long speaking intervals can incur similar ASR latency. Latency can vary across ASR implementations (In some cases, there is no network latency whatsoever as the model is embedded in the browser, 
### Turn-Taking / Interruption
_The System’s “Instinct”_
Turn-taking / Interruption (TTI) is an intermediary process that determines when a user is finished speaking. The underlying model is known as a Voice Activity Detector (or VAD).
Turn-Taking involves a complex set of rules. A short burst of speech (e.g. “uh-huh”) shouldn’t trigger a turn; otherwise, conversations would feel too staccato. Instead, it must assess when a user is actually trying to fetch the model’s attention. It also must determine when the user is finished relaying their thoughts.
A good VAD will _not_ signal a new turn whenever it detects silence. There is silence between words (and phrases), and the model needs to be confident that the user is actually done speaking. To accomplish this reliably, it needs to seek a threshold of silence (or more specifically, a lack of speech). This process introduces a delay, contributing to the overall latency experienced by the user.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Ff67pdwh696-image%20\(12\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
Technically speaking, if all of the other conversational AI components incurred _zero_ latency, the latency attributed to TTI would be a good thing. Humans take a beat before responding to speech. A machine taking a similar pause gives realism to the interaction. However, since other components of conversational AI already incur latency, minimal TTI latency is ideal.
### Text Processing
_The System’s Brain_
Next, the system needs to generate a response. Today, this is typically accomplished with a Large Language Model (LLM), such as GPT-4 or Gemini Flash 1.5.
The choice of the language model makes a significant difference. Models like Gemini Flash 1.5 are incredibly fast—generating outputs in less than 350ms. More robust models that can handle more complex queries—such as GPT-4 variants and Claude—could take between 700ms to 1000ms. **Choosing the right model is typically the easiest way to target latency when optimizing a conversational AI process.**
However, the latency of the LLM is time it takes to _start_ generating tokens. These tokens can be immediately streamed to the following [text-to-speech ](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech)process. Because text-to-speech is slowed by the natural pace of a human voice, the LLM reliably outpaces it—what matters most is the first token latency (i.e., time to first byte).
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F2xl46yd3fge-image%20\(13\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
There are other contributors to an LLM’s latency beyond the model’s choice. These include the prompt length and the size of the knowledge base. The larger of either, the longer the latency. It boils down to a simple principle: the more that the LLM need to consider, the longer it takes. Accordingly, companies need to strike a balance between a healthy amount of context without overburdening the model.
### Text to Speech
_The System’s Mouth_
The final component of conversational AI is [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) (TTS). Text-to-speech’s net latency is the time it takes to begin speaking after receiving input tokens from text-processing. That’s it—because additional tokens are made available at a rate faster than human speech, text-to-speech’s latency is strictly the time to first byte.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Ffz3eb40wlko-image%20\(14\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
Previously, [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) was particularly slow, taking as long as 2-3s to generate speech. However, state-of-the-art models like our Turbo engine are able to generate speech with just 300ms of latency the the new [Flash TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/meet-flash) engine is even faster. Flash **has a model time of 75ms** and can achieve an e2e 135ms of time to first byte audio latency, the best score in the field (we have to brag a little!).
## Additional Contributors
Beyond the four components, there some additional contributors to conversational AI’s net latency.
### Network Latency
There will always be latency associated with sending data from one location to another. For some conversational AI applications, the [ASR](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-to-text), TTI, LLM, and [TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) processes should ideally be co-located, so the only source of non-trivial network latency is the paths between speaker and the entire system. **This gives us an advantage on latency as we can save two server calls since we have our own TTS and an internal transcription solution.**
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fq7m4x6y5v2-image%20\(15\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
### Function Calling
A lot of conversational AI applications exist to invoke functions (i.e. interface with tools and services). For instance, I might verbally ask the AI to check the weather. This requires additional [API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/convert) calls invoked at the text-processing layer, which can incur significantly more latency depending on the needs.
For example, if I need to order a pizza verbally, there might be multiple [API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/convert) calls that are necessary, some with excessive lag (e.g. processing a credit card).
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fzqxhk8jqqx-image%20\(16\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
However, a conversational AI system can combat the delays associated with function calling by prompting the LLM to respond to the user before the function call is finished (e.g. “Let me check the weather for you”). This models a real-life conversation and doesn’t keep the user without engagement.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fozqtxewl5i9-image%20\(17\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
These async patterns are typically accomplished by leveraging webhooks to avoid long-running requests.
### Telephony
Another common feature for conversational AI platforms is to allow the user to dial-in via the phone (or, in some cases, make a phone call on behalf of the user). Telephony will incur additional latency—and this latency can be severely geography dependent.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fjk9j2dgylkl-image%20\(18\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
As a base, telephony will incur an additional 200ms of latency if contained to the same region. For global calls (e.g. Asia → USA), the travel time can increase significantly, with latency hitting ~500ms. This pattern could be common if users have phone numbers outside of the region that their located in—forcing a hop to their base country’s phone networks.
## A Closing Thought
We hope this round-trip exploration of conversational AI was interesting. In summary, applications should target a sub-second latency. This can typically be accomplished by choosing the right LLM for the task. They should also interface with the user whenever more complex processes are running in the background to prevent long pauses.
At the end of the day, the goal is to create realism. A user needs to feel the ease of talking to a human while getting the benefits of a computer program. By tightening the sub-processes, this is now possible.
At Elevenlabs we are optimizing every part of the piece of a conversational AI system with our state of the art STT and [TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) models. By working on each part of the process, we can achieve seamless conversation flows. This top-down view on orchestration allows us to shave off a little latency—even 1ms—at every juncture.

Throughout 2024, a range of elections are set to take place across the world. As they approach, we are focused on advancing the safe and fair use of AI voices. 
Our technology was born out of our commitment to breaking down language barriers and fostering global understanding. It continues to find inspiring applications in education, entertainment and accessibility, while also making content more engaging and inclusive. 
However, we recognize the changing landscape of AI technology and its implications for the political process. Ensuring our systems are developed, deployed, and used safely is our priority and we are taking additional measures to combat misuse and the spread of misinformation as the technology evolves. 
### Preventing misuse
In our continuing efforts to ensure a positive experience for all users of our platform, we’re taking specific steps to prevent AI voices from being used to spread misinformation. While our terms already prohibit using our platform to impersonate or harm others, we are taking the added measure of introducing a ‘**no-go voices** ’ safeguard. This safeguard is designed to detect and prevent the creation of voices that mimic political candidates actively involved in presidential or prime ministerial elections, starting with those in the US and the UK. We are working to expand this safeguard to other languages and election cycles. We also aim to continually refine this measure through practical testing and feedback. We invite fellow AI companies and partners to collaborate with us on exploring ways to improve and extend these safeguards effectively.
We are also actively testing new ways to counteract the creation of political content that could either affect participation in the democratic process or mislead voters. Our systems have always allowed us to trace content generated on our platform back to the originating account. We are actively developing new moderation and internal review mechanisms to identify and address abuse cases more effectively. Misrepresenting electoral processes, voter eligibility or the value of voting undermines democracy and we firmly oppose the use of AI to create confusion or distrust in the democratic system. Using our technology for political campaigning activity that involves impersonating others, creating chatbots, or placing robocalls is a direct violation of our terms.
### Transparency over AI-generated content
Enabling clear identification of AI-generated content is a key aspect of our responsible development efforts.
Last June we released the [AI Speech Classifier](https://elevenlabs.io/ai-speech-classifier), which allows anybody to upload audio samples for analysis as to whether the sample was AI-generated audio from ElevenLabs. Our goal is to help prevent the spread of misinformation by making the source of audio content easier to assess. If you're interested in either a partnership or an integration, please connect with us at [here](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_13297797982993=report_content).
### Balancing innovation and responsibility 
We are inspired by the positive applications our community continues to find for our technology. Throughout 2024 and beyond, we remain committed to responsible innovation by maintaining a continuous dialogue with our community, partners, civil society and key stakeholders.

## Overview 
Advanced text to speech technology gives conversational AI agents the ability to speak. While earlier speech output tended to be robotic and flat, innovative TTS tools like ElevenLabs allow conversational AI agents to respond like human assistants in real-time. 
## AI is finding its voice
Think back to your first interaction with a voice assistant or chatbot. Chances are, the voice sounded flat, robotic, or lifeless. While the information you received was probably helpful, the experience itself likely produced an uncanny valley effect, making the interaction feel artificial and eerie. 
Fast forward to today, and [real-time text to speech technology](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) is changing how conversational AI interacts with users. By enabling AI assistants to respond in a human-like manner, paired with realistic voices, tones, and inflections, TTS transforms previously robotic interactions into natural dialogue. 
Additionally, real-time output eliminates artificial delays in speech, allowing conversations between robots and humans to flow naturally. 
Let’s explore how real-time TTS is driving the evolution of conversational AI, making it more accessible and impactful across a wide range of applications.
## What is real-time text to speech?
Before delving deeper into the exciting developments in conversational AI, we need to understand what real-time text to speech is and how it works. Let’s revisit the basics for a second. 
Real-time text to speech is a technology that instantly processes written text and converts it into spoken language. This process significantly differs from earlier TTS outputs, which often included time lags and errors. In contrast, real-time speech output allows AI systems to keep the conversation going, creating smoother and more dynamic interactions.
But how were we able to achieve such significant developments in such a short period? 
Thanks to advancements in AI algorithms and natural language processing, modern text to speech systems can produce voices that sound clear and human-like. Unlike prerecorded audio, real-time TTS generates speech on the go, allowing AI to adapt its responses instantly based on user input.
## Why is real-time TTS essential for conversational AI?

## Overview
A silent virtual experience can feel incomplete. Without narration, a virtual museum tour lacks context, an online travel guide feels impersonal, and an educational VR simulation struggles to hold attention. Adding a voice to these experiences provides a layer of realism, making the content feel alive and engaging. Text to speech (TTS) technology plays a crucial role in this transformation, offering natural-sounding, customizable narration.
## The impact of voice on virtual experiences
When it comes to storytelling, narration style matters just as much as the words being spoken. 
The right voice can add depth, pacing, and personality, making an experience more compelling and memorable. Voice adds tone, pacing, and emphasis, molding a passive virtual experience into an interactive journey. It’s why guided museum tours have human narrators and why [video games](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-create-video-game-characters-npcs-voices) rely on voice acting to draw players into their worlds.
In virtual and augmented reality, a voice can bridge the digital world and the user. 
A well-placed narration can provide historical context, offer navigational guidance, or make the experience more engaging. Instead of requiring users to read paragraphs, [text to speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) allows them to listen and stay immersed in the environment without growing bored. 
TTS is also a cost-effective and quick solution for businesses and content creators. With AI-generated speech, narration can be created on demand, edited effortlessly, and even adapted to different languages with minimal effort.
## Why use text to speech for virtual experiences?
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fen0vwkjfgof-ryanmorrisonjer_A_high-resolution_photograph_captured_with_a__6db0953e-c1bc-4224-83e9-45cd022c3614_2.webp&w=3840&q=95)
As we’ve touched upon above, advanced text to speech tools are excellent additions to virtual tours and immersive experiences. 
Let’s explore the benefits in more detail: 
### Provides engaging and expressive narration
A voice can shape how we perceive a story. A flat, robotic delivery can dull even the most thrilling content, while expressive speech draws listeners in. AI-powered TTS platforms now offer speech synthesis that replicates human speech through voice, pace, and emotion. 
Imagine a digital art gallery tour using an [enthusiastic virtual narrator](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/ai-virtual-narrator) to bring paintings to life, or an educational science simulation incorporating a more mysterious tone to maintain curiosity and excitement. 
Although subtle, these elements keep users engaged and immersed.
### Makes experiences more accessible
Not everyone experiences digital content the same way. 
TTS is an essential accessibility tool for visually impaired users or those who struggle with reading. Spoken narration ensures everyone can engage with virtual environments, making content more inclusive. 
Accessibility also extends beyond specific impairments. TTS benefits users who prefer audio over text. Many people absorb information better when they hear it rather than reading it. By incorporating narration, virtual experiences become more intuitive and user-friendly.
### Offers multilingual narration
Many virtual tours cater to international audiences. Instead of creating separate recordings for each language, TTS allows for real-time multilingual support. 
Users can switch between languages at the click of a button, allowing them to experience the environment in their native language. 
For example, a virtual tour of the Louvre can provide descriptions in French, English, Spanish, and Mandarin in an instant. This type of language adaptability breaks barriers and ensures everyone feels included. 
### Provides a cost-effective and scalable solution
Producing high-quality voiceovers can be expensive, especially for large-scale virtual projects. TTS eliminates the need for costly recording sessions and [professional voice actors](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/will-ai-replace-voice-actors), allowing businesses to scale their experiences on a budget.
Moreover, updates and modifications are also easier. If a virtual museum adds a new exhibit, a new narration can be generated instantly, avoiding the time and expense of hiring a voice actor for minor changes.
## How to integrate TTS into virtual experiences in four simple steps
Adding TTS to a virtual environment is easier than ever, thanks to the availability of AI-powered speech tools and developer-friendly APIs. Here’s how to get started.
### 1. Select the right voice
Choosing the right voice is paramount to creating an immersive virtual experience. A historical documentary might need a deep, authoritative tone, while a children’s VR adventure will benefit from a warm, energetic narrator. 
Advanced text to speech platforms like ElevenLabs offer voice selection and customization tools that allow creators to experiment with different styles before deciding on the best fit.
### 2. Set up your TTS integration
Most modern TTS solutions, including ElevenLabs, provide easy-to-use [text to speech APIs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech/convert) that can be integrated into digital experiences. The process typically involves:
  * Signing up for a TTS service and obtaining an API key.
  * Sending text input to generate real-time or pre-recorded speech output.
  * Customizing parameters such as voice pitch, speed, and tone to match the experience.
## [ ![](https://eleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io/payloadcms/ny0gewy5ca-api.svg)TEXT TO SPEECH API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech)
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Ftts-api.jpg&w=3840&q=95)
Easily integrate our low-latency Text to Speech API and bring crisp, high-quality voices to your applications with minimal coding effort
### 3. Use SSML for heightened realism
Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a powerful tool for fine-tuning TTS output. It allows developers to add pauses, emphasize words, and control pronunciation, making narration sound more natural. 
SSML is especially useful for experiences that require dramatic storytelling or precise articulation.
### 4. Test and refine the narration
Testing is essential to ensure the best experience. Listening to TTS-generated speech within the virtual environment helps identify areas where pacing, pronunciation, or emphasis might need adjustments. Gathering feedback from users can also highlight ways to refine the narration further.
## Final thoughts
Adding voice to a virtual experience helps users feel more connected and engaged. Well-crafted narration can pull viewers in and keep them engaged during a virtual tour, storytelling adventure, or interactive learning model. 
Text to speech technology makes it easier than ever to incorporate high-quality voiceovers without the blood, sweat, and tears of endless recording sessions. And this is just the beginning. As AI-driven speech synthesis continues to become more natural and expressive, the future of virtual experiences will be more engaging, accessible, and adaptable than ever before.

[Text-to-SFX](https://elevenlabs.io/blog)
Video without sound always feels like it is missing something important. You can see a busy city scene and imagine the noises, but the video truly becomes real when you can hear the scene play out, including the roar of car engines, the rustle of the wind and chatter of people.
ElevenLabs' AI-powered [video-to-sound generator](https://videotosfx.elevenlabs.io/) makes adding sound effects to your videos easier than ever. Simply upload your video, and our AI will analyze the content to generate a variety of [sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) that you can download and use.
## How it works
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fkunfaia9h2t-Blog%20\(10\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
The video-to-sound generator experiment combines AI vision with the [ElevenLabs SFX API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/how-to-use-text-to-sound-effects) to analyze frames in the video to understand what is happening. It looks for key features such as vehicles, people and scenes then generates sound effects to match the scenario.
For example, if your video features a car chase, the AI will generate sound effects such as tire screeches, engine roars, and crashes. If you show a busker playing guitar next to a busy road it will generate the sound of the guitar but also the road noises.
Or, as seen in these examples, you can create relatively mundane sounds for a bus pulling away from a stop, or a watch shown through a shop window on a rainy day.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fqny2s2rht5r-vlcsnap-2025-02-25-12h26m21s889.webp&w=3840&q=95)
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fjpduao07ql9-vlcsnap-2025-02-25-12h26m04s442.webp&w=3840&q=95)
For total control over the output you can still use the ElevenLabs [text-to-sfx](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) generator in our app. This lets you customize the duration and write a detailed prompt. But using the video-to-sound generator can sometimes come up with sounds you might not have considered.
The main advantage of adding sound to AI video, including from Google’s Veo 2, Runway Gen-3, Kling 1.6, Pika 2.1 or any number of AI video models is simply to improve the experience. The added dimension of sound can make your videos more immersive and engaging.
**Using the video-to-sound generator is simple:**
  * Go to the [ElevenLabs video-to-sound](https://videotosfx.elevenlabs.io/) page and upload your video.
  * The AI will analyze your video and generate a variety of sound effects.
  * You can play any of the four sounds and it will also play a preview of your video.

This article explores how to use ElevenLabs' AI voiceovers and sound effects to enhance Google's Veo 2 photorealistic videos, creating truly immersive viewing experiences.

Google's Veo 2 makes generating photorealistic videos easier than ever, but visuals alone aren't enough. Sound transforms a silent sequence into a fully immersive experience, and that's where ElevenLabs comes in. With ElevenLabs, generating a dynamic [AI voiceover](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) in a range of languages or adding [sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) can transform a simple video into a captivating story.
I tried to do just that when I used Veo 2 from Google's DeepMind lab to tell the story of a city that never sleeps. I generated 18 different clips, each around 5-8 seconds long, with a focus on urban settings. The clips feature neon signs, rain, a train, and various street scenes. To bring these fragmented moments together, I added a voiceover and sound effects using ElevenLabs.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fjpduao07ql9-vlcsnap-2025-02-25-12h26m04s442.webp&w=3840&q=95)
## **Crafting a Captivating Voiceover**
A well-crafted AI voiceover brings structure and emotional depth to your video. While it might be the best video generator for realism, Veo 2 clips often lack scene or character consistency, making narration the perfect unifying element.
Instead of leaving the viewer to interpret fragmented visuals, a carefully designed voiceover provides clarity, guiding them through the story. You can either start with the voiceover script then create clips to match, or start with the shots (usually from a storyboard) then write to the shots. For the city video, I created the prompts first.
ElevenLabs' text-to-speech technology ensures professional-grade narration without the need for expensive recording setups. The flexibility to control tone, pacing, and emotion means you can fine-tune your voiceover to fit the mood of your project effortlessly. There are also thousands of voices to choose from to get exactly the right character. 
### **Planning Your Narration**
Before generating a voiceover, it's important to plan how narration will complement your video. If, like mine, your Veo 2 sequence is a cinematic urban montage, voiceover can establish setting, add poetic reflection, or enhance the atmosphere.
For example, in my video, I have a scene of neon-lit streets and flickering signs. So I wrote: "The city never sleeps — it barely even blinks. It inhales exhaust fumes and exhales neon light, a beast of steel and glass pulsing with the footsteps of a million restless souls." This bridges together several shots.
### **Scripting Your Voiceover**
Once you've outlined your narration, the next step is scripting for the entire video. A well-written script ensures your voiceover aligns with the timing of your clips. Since Veo 2 scenes are often 5 to 8 seconds long, your narration should be concise and well-paced. A 5-second clip allows for around 12-15 words, while an 8-second clip fits approximately 20-25 words.
The tone of your narration should match your video — poetic for atmospheric visuals, documentary-style for informative sequences, and cinematic for high-energy storytelling. For example, a slow-motion shot of steam rising from a manhole might be narrated with, "The city exhales, steam twisting into the cold night air," while a train pulling into a station might warrant, "A gust of wind. The screech of metal. Another train pulls in, just like the hundreds before it."
## Generating Your Voiceover with ElevenLabs
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fv8yflvugyj-sfx%20\(3\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
Once your script is polished, it's time to generate your AI voiceover with ElevenLabs. Head over to the text-to-speech page in the ElevenLabs app. Here you can paste your script, or you can write it directly. You can then select a voice on the right, as well as set its speed, stability, and other features. I like to add 10-20% style exaggeration as it improves characterization.
A deep, cinematic tone works well for dramatic urban sequences, while a soft, reflective voice enhances poetic narratives. For fast-paced visuals, an energetic delivery keeps the rhythm engaging. For my video, [I used Lamar Lincoln](https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-library?voiceId=CVRACyqNcQefTlxMj9bt), a premium voice that gave a more natural feel to the story. I wanted it to sound like someone reflecting on something they care about.
After entering your script, fine-tune the speed and emotion of the voiceover to match your visuals. A slower, deliberate pace suits dramatic moments, while a more conversational tone complements an energetic montage. Once you're satisfied with the result, download the audio file and prepare to sync it with your video.
I prefer to use just one or two sentences to fine-tune the voice on, then generate based on the full script. Although in this case, the script was only three paragraphs so using the entire script wasn't so much of an issue. It also worked well from the start.
### **Syncing Your Voiceover**
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Ftms4o8yjxee-sfx%20\(2\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
Syncing the AI voiceover with your Veo 2 clips is a straightforward process using editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, or CapCut.
  * Import your video clips, add the voiceover to the timeline, and adjust the start and end points to align with the visuals.
  * Use crossfades or time-stretching if necessary to ensure a seamless blend between narration and motion.
## Enhancing with Sound Effects
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Foz10u37zwpn-sfx%20\(1\).webp&w=3840&q=95)
Once the voiceover is in place, it's time to enhance your video with sound effects. AI-generated sound effects complete the auditory experience by adding realism and texture. A video clip on its own can be as real as something filmed with a phone, but without sound, it will fall into that unreality chasm that leaves you feeling like something is missing.
### **Creating Sound Effects with ElevenLabs**
ElevenLabs' [text-to-sfx generator](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects) allows you to create custom audio elements, from ambient city noise to subtle environmental sounds. You can describe a full soundscape with a complex prompt, or generate multiple files each with an individual set of sounds that you then layer in your video editor.
To create the sound effects, head to the ElevenLabs SFX generator. You can explore a list of pre-made sound effects in our library, or create a custom sound using the text-to-sfx generator. You can even simplify the process by trying our [video-to-sound](https://videotosfx.elevenlabs.io/) experiment. This lets you upload a single clip and it will provide 4 sound effects you can download.
If you want more control over the sounds, head to the sound effects generator. Here you type in a prompt and click generate. You can also customize the duration of the clip from 0.5 and 22 seconds by clicking the Settings button.
### **Prompting for Sound Effects**
## [ ![](https://eleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io/payloadcms/jhuh89ywrfl-text-to-sfx.svg)TEXT TO SOUND EFFECTS](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects)
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Felevenlabs-text-to-sound-effects-card.jpg&w=3840&q=95)
Create sound effects, instrumental tracks, and more 
While you can give a complex prompt with a fully descriptive explanation of the entire soundscape, I've found it better to create a series of prompts and layer them on top of one another. This lets you control the point different sounds play based on the contents of the video.
A well-placed sound effect makes a scene feel real — footsteps echoing in an alley, the distant honk of a car, or the rhythmic drip of rain on pavement. Pairing these sounds with your visuals enhances immersion, making each frame more impactful.
If your video features a flickering neon sign, a faint electrical buzz in the background reinforces its presence. If a subway train screeches to a halt, layering in metal-on-metal friction adds authenticity.
**Prompting Examples:**
  * **Descriptive Prompt:** "Soft ticking of a watch's second hand, faint rustle of coat sleeve adjusting, ambient city noise in the background — muted horns, distant conversation, occasional flicker of neon signs, slight metallic scrape as the wrist turns."
  * **Layered Prompts:**
  *     * "Soft ticking of a watch's second hand"
    * "Faint rustle of a coast sleeve adjusting"
    * "Ambient city noise"
You can then stack these on top of each other in your video editor.
Once you have the sound layered and volume for each clip set to create the perfect output, export and share your video.
Whether you're crafting a cinematic montage, a poetic city reflection, or a documentary-style short film, AI-generated audio brings your vision to life. Try ElevenLabs today and transform your Veo 2 video into a fully immersive experience with the power of voice and sound.

## Choosing the Best AI Voice Generator — 6 Factors That Matter 
### 1. Voice quality
Voice quality is, arguably, the single most important factor that impacts your audience’s experience. Whether you’re using an AI voice generator as a content creator or a business managing customer calls, it’s the voice quality that forms an impression of your brand. 
If you bet on high-quality text to speech software, you’ll boost your audience’s trust, help them stay focused, and make the content easier to understand (especially for second-language users).
Daniel Vasilevsky, the Director and Owner of 
“Many voice generators sound stiff or robotic, so I wanted something that felt real and conversational. I needed a tone that would make customers comfortable and assured like they were speaking to a real person rather than a machine,” he said.
Here is a tip from us — try to demo each voice generator before making the final decision. Run sample text through the tool and ask yourself:
  * How clear is the sound?
  * Is it easy to understand the pronunciation?
  * Does it sound genuinely human, or is there something slightly “off” about it?
At ElevenLabs, you can test our [text to speech generator](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) right on our homepage — without signing up for a trial.
### 2. Voice customization options 
Customizing the voice is another important factor, closely linked (but not identical) to audio quality. It relates to aspects like the voice generator’s ability to adjust tone, pitch, speed, and emotions. These aspects matter because you’ll want to adjust them to the type of voice content you’re generating – or the audience you’re targeting. 
Loris Petro, Marketing Manager of 
Meanwhile, for Paul Posea, Outreach Specialist at 
“Our outreach is based on personalization, so it is crucial that clients feel like they're speaking with a real person rather than a robot. After all, it’s the ability to convey human inflection in one's voice that draws the audience in,” he told us.
“My most recent experiment with email-based cold outreach, where I used voice messages mimicking my voice, showed a 30% uptick in replies. The difference? It came across as more of a conversation than a sales presentation.”
When looking for a generator that fits your needs, ask yourself the following:
  * How realistic does the voice need to sound? Does it require human-like intonation and emotions?
  * Does it support my preferred language and accent? This question will particularly apply if you want to localize your content across different markets.
  * Does it offer a variety of voices or, better yet, allow me to clone my voice?
To put this into perspective, consider two scenarios:
  * A YouTube channel with strong personal branding – where the creator has always used their voice for voice-overs.
  * A YouTube channel where the team or individual behind it isn’t widely recognized – possibly relying on AI-generated narration.
In the first case, the creator’s voice has become an integral part of the brand after years of recording voice-overs. Now, they want to scale production without having to record every script themselves or provide the same content across multiple languages. In contrast, the second channel focuses on making sure the AI-generated voices they use sound as natural and lifelike as possible. 
Both of these scenarios are easy to handle in ElevenLabs, where you can choose from a variety of licensed voices or provide a sample of your own to create life-like audio content.
### 3. Scalability 
“Scalability” can relate to different aspects of AI voice generators. [For a call center,](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/convin) it may mean the ability to handle AI-powered conversations with a growing customer base without any latency caused by a sudden spike in call volume. For others, it’s more about the ability to produce podcast or video content quickly, without compromising on the speed of voice generation or the audio’s quality. 
However, some general questions can help you verify if a given AI voice generator can keep up with your needs:
  * Looking into the future, how much will my needs or user demand change if my project proves successful? Can the tool I’m looking at keep up?
  * Does the AI voice generator offer a free plan and – if I decided to upgrade – affordable tiers, so I can scale as needed?
For instance, ElevenLabs is not only a stable, scalable solution, but it also offers a variety of plans for all types of users. The free plan offers 10k credits, and then 30k credits under the affordable $5/month plan. It’s easy to scale up or down as needed.

Expand your reach to global audiences by translating your content for foreign audiences. Let our AI and bilingual dubbing experts do the work for you.
###  4. Ease of use 
The best AI voice generators are easy to use. It’s an important factor because it directly impacts your productivity and how likely you are to use the tool. A user-friendly interface lets you generate voices quickly without a steep learning curve. 
Not everyone using it will be super tech-savvy. So, the UI must be simple enough for content creators, marketers, and customer success teams to pick up easily. A complex interface can lead to errors or call for extensive training. 
Here are a couple of questions to ask:
  * Can the tool integrate smoothly into my workflow or platform (e.g., via APIs, plugins, or SDKs)?
  * Is it compatible with the systems or devices I plan to use?
At ElevenLabs we created an AI voice generator that’s beginner-friendly. The layout is minimalistic with all tools in the left-hand menu, and easy-to-adjust settings. You’ll mainly use three sliders to tweak the voice, then choose the one that sounds best. 
ElevenLabs can even suggest the most suitable model for your needs. Once you’re happy with the settings, paste your text and click “Generate speech” — and that’s it!
We also provide officially supported libraries that are updated with the latest features available in the [REST API](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/introduction) and those designed for use with ElevenLabs [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/overview).
### 5. Data security 
An AI voice generator is without a doubt an exciting technology. However, some people use it for wrong things. We’ve seen cases where bad actors create convincing voice messages to manipulate individuals or businesses into transferring money or revealing sensitive information. That’s why strong security measures are essential to prevent such incidents. 
At ElevenLabs, [safety ](https://elevenlabs.io/safety)is our top priority across all AI audio products, including text to speech software and voice generators. We use automated content moderation, human review, and safeguards against high-risk voice creation to stop misuse. Additionally, our proprietary voiceCAPTCHA ensures that only authorized users can clone voices. To promote transparency, we also offer AI detection tools to check if the content is AI-generated. 
### 6. Licensing
Don’t overlook licensing. It’s key when choosing the best AI voice generator because it determines how you can legally use the generated voices. Some tools are free to use but restrict commercial applications, so if you need voices for marketing or voiceovers, you’ll require a commercial license.
Always check the licensing agreement before committing to an AI voice generator to ensure it aligns with your needs. Here are a few aspects to pay attention to:
  * **Copyright and ownership** – some providers retain ownership of generated audio, meaning, you might not have full rights to distribute or monetize it. Ensure the license allows unrestricted use.
  * **Usage restrictions** – licenses may limit usage based on factors like distribution channels, audience size, or content type (e.g., audiobooks vs ads)
  * **Scalability & costs** – licensing terms often affect pricing, with different tiers based on usage volume. Understanding the terms helps avoid unexpected costs.
It’s important to realize that some AI voices are modeled after real people, which can create legal risks if used without permission. At ElevenLabs, we partnered with industry legends to improve your reading experience.

## Overview
The way we create and manipulate sound has evolved significantly with the rise of artificial intelligence. AI sound effects and background voices have become essential tools in film, gaming, and content creation, offering an efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional recording methods. Instead of relying on extensive sound libraries or hiring multiple voice actors, creators can now generate high-quality audio in minutes using AI-powered tools.
## Using AI to create sound effects and background voices in media
As exciting as it may be, sound design can be a challenging profession to navigate. From costly studio sessions to multiple retakes, it's difficult to obtain your desired results off the bat. 
Thankfully, developments in artificial intelligence and [speech synthesis](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) are providing technicians with faster and more flexible ways to create realistic sound effects and background voices for various media. 
These advancements in [AI sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/sound-effects-are-here) and background voices are rooted in machine learning and deep neural networks. Both systems analyze large datasets of recorded sounds and speech patterns to generate new, highly realistic audio outputs that fit effortlessly into various media applications.
That said, let’s explore how AI advancements contribute to sound design in practice. 
### AI-generated sound effects for immersive audio
AI sound effects bring environments and experiences to life. 
These elements enhance immersion, whether it’s the sound of footsteps, a car engine revving, or the ambiance of a bustling city street. AI sound effect generators synthesize these sounds using deep learning models based on real-world recordings and user-defined parameters.
The benefit of AI sound effects lies in their adaptability. Unlike pre-recorded audio samples, AI tools allow users to customize intensity, pitch, and duration, ensuring that each sound effect perfectly matches its intended scene. These features make them invaluable for video game developers, filmmakers, and virtual reality creators who require [highly specific and interactive soundscapes](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-add-sound-effects-to-your-video-with-elevenlabs-video-to-sound-generator).
### AI-generated background voices that sound like the real deal
Background voices play a crucial role in making a scene feel authentic. 
From indistinct crowd chatter to minor character dialogues, AI-generated voice technology enables the creation of [natural-sounding background voices](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-generate-natural-sounding-voices-with-text-to-speech-ai) without the need for human actors for every role.
Modern AI-generated voice tools can mimic various tones, accents, and emotions, making them highly versatile. Users can adjust speech speed, pitch, and even the emotional tone of AI-generated voice outputs with customization options. 
These developments are particularly useful for video games and animated films, where various background voices can make virtual worlds feel more real.
## Diving deeper: How is AI revolutionizing the sphere of sound design?
The rise of AI in sound design is understandable, given its ability to speed up production while maintaining high-quality output. Here’s why more creators are integrating AI into their workflows:
### Faster production without compromising quality
Recording, editing, and mixing sound manually is a time-consuming process. AI-powered tools drastically cut down production time by generating sounds instantly. Due to this decrease in production time, creators are free to focus more on refining the final audio rather than spending hours sourcing or recording sounds.
### Expanding creative possibilities
AI unlocks new creative possibilities by allowing sound design professionals to experiment with sounds that may be difficult or impossible to capture manually. 
Want a robotic voice with a touch of human emotion? Need an entirely new futuristic ambient sound? AI can generate [unique and custom-tailored AI sound effects](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/create-sound-effects-using-ai) that traditional methods might struggle to create.
### Cost-effective sound production
Hiring voice actors, booking studio time, and acquiring sound libraries can be pricey, to say the least. AI eliminates many of these costs by offering high-quality alternatives. Small teams and independent creators can now achieve professional-grade sound design without exceeding their budgets.
## How to create AI sound effects and background voices in 4 simple steps 
While AI-based sound design may sound complicated at first, it’s actually a relatively simple process. Whether you’re new to sound design or have a few years of experience, you can also dip your toes into the AI waters in just four simple steps: 
### Step 1: Choose the right AI tool
Different AI tools specialize in various aspects of sound design. Some focus on realistic AI-generated voice synthesis, while others are built for environmental AI sound effects. Selecting the right platform ensures the best possible results for your project.
### Step 2: Customize parameters 
Once a tool is chosen, users can adjust parameters like tone, pitch, and speech pace for AI-generated voice outputs. For AI sound effects, intensity and duration can be modified to match the desired atmosphere.
### Step 3: Refine and optimize the generated audio
While AI does much of the heavy lifting, final tweaks often enhance realism. Mixing AI sound effects with additional effects or adjusting EQ settings ensures the best outcome.
### Step 4: Implement the AI-generated sound into your project
Once finalized, the AI-generated audio is ready for integration into films, games, animations, or other media, adding depth and immersion to the overall experience.

## 5-Steps to outstanding YouTube voiceovers
Okay, so enough about the context. By now, you'll be raring to go, ready to create your very own faceless YouTube videos using the power of AI.
But where exactly do you even start? In this section, we'll discuss the five steps of generating high-quality audio for your next YouTube video using ElevenLabs.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fkhw89pep6n8-DALL%C3%82%C2%B7E%202024-08-19%2009.50.39%20-%20A%20high-quality%20digital%20illustration%20of%20a%20YouTube%20video%20being%20viewed%20on%20a%20laptop%20placed%20on%20a%20desk.%20The%20laptop%20screen%20shows%20the%20YouTube%20interface%20with%20a.webp&w=3840&q=95)
### **Step 1: access voice design**
Start the whole process by generating a comprehensive script. Remember - your script is the most critical part of your video's audio, so getting this right is important. For this stage, you can either use an AI tool like ChatGPT, or (for more professional or nuanced content) hire an expert script-writer using 
Once you've got your script, it's time to start generating high-quality voiceovers. Begin by navigating the ElevenLabs website and heading to the [Voice Lab](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-lab) section. You'll find the tools you need to create a custom voiceover here. Look for the "Add Voice" option, then select "Voice Design" from the menu to begin the process.
### **Step 2: customize your voice**
Now, it's time to unleash your creativity.
With VoiceLab, you can dictate precisely what your natural-sounding voice-over sounds like. You can create an imaginary personality based on your target audience, choose from the range of standard TTS voices in the ElevenLabs library, or use the voice cloning functionality to clone your own voice.
Once you've developed your character, play with the accent settings to give your voiceover a particular regional nuance or international flavor. There are infinite combinations in the ElevenLabs pronunciation library, so get creative.
Remember, you only have to do this step once if you want to reuse the same voice in every YouTube video. Once you've created your voice, the ElevenLabs program will store your voice for next time. Then, when you're ready to make your next video, you can generate your voiceover in just a few clicks.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F6lfg7qmmxhp-cg58h7xw1b8&w=3840&q=95)
### **Step 3: generate and preview**
After selecting your preferred identity settings, it's time to bring your voice to life.
On ElevenLabs, click "Generate." In moments, Voice Design will create a unique voiceover tailored to your specifications. Preview the result and see if it matches your expectations and the tone of your YouTube video.
### **Step 4: fine-tune your creation**
Happy with your results? Skip this step!
But if you're not entirely satisfied or looking for more character in your voice, don't panic. [Voice Design](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/rvg/) allows for easy adjustments in the program itself.
You might want to increase the accent strength, choose an alternative voice, or make any other subtle tweaks to perfect the voiceover and make it sound natural. Perhaps you're imagining a more serious tone or looking for a more lighthearted feel.
Whatever it is, make the necessary changes, hit "Generate" again, and preview the new result. You can repeat this step as many times as necessary before you get exactly the voice you want.
## Benefits of using AI voice overs
Using AI tools to generate digital and textual content is a fantastic way to cut costs and save time while generating excellent output.
Let's explore some benefits of generating audio for your next YouTube video using ElevenLabs.
### Using text-to-speech technology is fast
Firstly, ElevenLabs is rapid speech software. It can generate professional-level speech for YouTube in minutes, and to begin, you only need a text-based script.
While traditional human voice-over artists will need time to prepare, record, and re-record their output depending on your feedback, ElevenLabs can generate a single audio file with a consistent tone in just a few clicks.
Seriously, you need less than five minutes with this software to finish your YouTube audio content, and humans just cannot compete.
### AI tools are much cheaper than human voice overs
Not only is ElevenLabs rapid, it's also very affordable.
Save your money on that expensive mic, and don't bother paying hourly rates for those human voice over artists. With ElevenLabs, you can create videos with different voices and in different languages at a fraction of the cost.
The monthly subscription starts from just $5/ month. At this level, you can generate artificial speech with an allowance that renews every month. ElevenLabs' powerful speech engine generates text-to-speech at the touch of a button, offering subscribers exclusive other features.
### Get a professional level audio file in minutes
Above all this, the quality of ElevenLabs speech software is unmatched.
Whether you're looking for female voices who can speak multiple languages, a text-to-speech voice with your regional accent, or a speech converter to change your voice into the spoken words of your favorite character, ElevenLabs has it all.
Plus, every audio file is perfect, with no annoying background noise and no need for long hours spent editing audio. Even without a fancy audio studio setup, you can generate pristine audio content with crisp voice quality indistinguishable from the real thing.
All these factors mean that generating AI audio content using text-to-speech technology like ElevenLabs is a viable, and even preferable, alternative to recording your own voice overs.
## Best practises to get your AI YouTube channel monetized
Now you've done all the work, how can you monetize your YouTube videos on your channel?
Monetization on YouTube videos doesn't require a specific number of videos or shorts uploaded. Instead, YouTube's monetization policy in 2025 requires that content creators have at least 1,000 subscribers to their channel and at least 4,000 hours of video watch time in the past 12 months.
Those are some serious numbers, yet you can generate that response from just a single video that goes down well. So, what are some top tips for monetizing your text-to-speech generated YouTube videos?
Firstly, make sure that your content discusses a theme that resonates with a wider audience. This will attract viewers and boost subscribers. Ensure your content speaks directly to your target market by using custom voices that suit your demographic. Then, make sure your script is great quality, not just regurgitated content that other videos use.
Next, it's critical that the voice generation tool you use creates top-quality, human-like voices. No one likes to think of themselves as watching an automated video. The best-performing YouTubers build a personal connection with their audience. While this is slightly harder to do with AI voice generation, it's not impossible, and top quality should always be your number one aim.
Finally, make sure your content follows YouTube guidelines. This means that content for children is appropriately signaled and that your videos do not discuss controversial topics or banned subjects.
Don't forget there are many other ways to 
## Final thoughts
It's an exciting time to be an online content creator, as AI tools, such as text-to-speech software and voice cloning generation, make creating video content easier than ever before. From experimenting with different languages to cloning your voice into different accents and genders, voice software like ElevenLabs makes it cheap, quick, and easy to play with audio in radically new ways.
However, it's important to remember that not all AI tools are created equal. Poor-quality video content will never perform as well as higher-quality counterparts, so creators must choose their tools wisely.
With ElevenLabs, professional-level voiceover content can be generated in a few clicks, taking the stress out of recording and re-recording audio for the perfect sound. This means new content creators can rapidly develop new videos, increasing their chances of monetization and improving their income potential.

With an AI voice generator, creators can instantly generate [professional-quality and immersive voiceovers](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/creating-immersive-content-with-ai-driven-text-to-speech), reducing the need for lengthy recording and editing sessions.
### Creators can customize voiceovers for different content styles
Not all videos require the same tone. A TikTok voice generator might be used for fun and energetic content, while an Instagram voice changer could help creators achieve a more polished or dramatic narration. AI voice technology lets users tailor voiceovers to match their brand identity and audience preferences.
## How to pick the best AI voice for your content
Not all AI voice generator tools offer the same features. Choosing the best option depends on several factors, including voice quality, customization options, and platform compatibility. To take the guesswork out of the equation, we’ve compiled a list of aspects to consider when [choosing an AI-driven tool for video production](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/top-ai-tools-for-video-content): 
### Find the right tone and style for your videos
The tone of an AI voice TikTok narration should align with the content. A high-energy voice works best for humorous content, while a natural, warm voice enhances engagement for storytelling or educational content.
### Explore customization features for brand consistency
A reliable AI voice generator should offer voice customization options like pitch, speed, and emotion. This feature helps ensure consistency across TikTok and Instagram content while keeping your style recognizable.
### Test different AI voices before committing
Many platforms offer free trials or sample voice generation. Before choosing a TikTok voice generator or Instagram voice changer, you should test various voices to find the one that best fits your content strategy.
## A quick guide to using an AI voice generator
Using an AI voice generator in 2025 is easier than ever. While older speech synthesis tools included many moving parts (not to mention a very robotic output), modern tools are easy to understand and navigate. 
That said, let’s look at four simple steps you can take to start creating realistic and engaging narrations for your videos: 
### Step 1: Choose a high-quality AI voice platform
Not all AI voice generators offer the same level of quality. To ensure your content sounds professional and engaging, choose a platform with realistic, expressive voices. 
ElevenLabs is an excellent option, providing AI voices with natural intonation and emotional depth. In addition, you can also choose to [clone your own voice](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-cloning) or design one from scratch for 100% originality. 
Look for platforms that offer voice customization, multiple accents, and high-quality output. A good AI voice generator should let you tailor voices to fit your brand or storytelling needs while maintaining clarity.
### Step 2: Select a voice and adjust the settings
Once you’ve chosen a platform, explore the available voice options. 
Many AI voice generators include tones, accents, and styles suited for various types of content. A lively voice works best for an energetic TikTok video, while a calm and authoritative voice may be the right choice for a more professional Instagram reel.
Most AI voice tools, including TikTok voice generators and Instagram voice changers, allow you to modify pitch, speed, and emphasis. Adjusting these settings helps the voice match your content’s style and audience. Test different configurations until you find the right balance.
### Step 3: Generate and review the voiceover
After selecting a voice, input your text and generate the voiceover. Remember to preview the voice before finalizing it. This is a crucial step, as minor tweaks can significantly improve the result.
Listen carefully to the AI voice and ensure it sounds natural and engaging. If needed, adjust tone, pacing, or phrasing to enhance clarity and flow. Some AI voice tools also allow you to insert pauses or emphasize keywords for a more dynamic delivery.
### Step 4: Integrate the AI voice into your content
Once your voiceover is ready, add it to your TikTok, Instagram, or other social media videos. Most video editing apps allow you to sync the voiceover with your visuals.
For a more polished result, consider layering background music or sound effects alongside the AI-generated voice. A well-balanced mix of audio elements enhances storytelling and keeps viewers engaged.
By following these steps, you can use AI voice generators to [create high-quality voiceovers for your social media](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-integrate-ai-text-to-speech-into-social-media-strategies). With tools like ElevenLabs, you get expressive, natural-sounding voices that make your videos more engaging and professional.

[Contact Sales](https://elevenlabs.io/contact-sales)[Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai)
Today, the LLM has emerged as the beating heart of conversational AI systems. Specifically, LLMs enable [conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) — originally built around sprawling phone trees — to feature dynamic functionality and provide human-like experiences. However, LLMs aren’t a silver bullet upgrade; they require specialized prompting as they aren’t fine-tuned to human speech by default.
Developers make a common mistake when prompting LLMs for conversational AI: recycling the same playbook that was used to train human employees. This strategy, despite sounding straightforward, is rarely fruitful. LLMs make different assumptions than typical humans, and their default tone and scope aren’t conducive to verbal interactions.
Today, we’ll uncover what we know about how to prompt LLMs to build successful conversational AI systems. You can also read a more comprehensive and technical guide to this topic in the [ElevenLabs Developer docs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/best-practices/prompting-guide). 
## The Old System
Prior to LLMs, conversational AI systems leveraged sprawling logic trees that requests would triage through based on verbal inputs. This setup was popular among customer service numbers (e.g., airline hotlines) and payment systems (e.g., credit card phone services).
These older systems were sluggish, felt robot-like, and could only permit very limited human inputs. There’s a fair chance you experienced this yourself, bluntly yelling “YES” into a phone to answer a prompt. This poor experience led most users to attempt to “beat the system” to force a conversation with a live human agent.
However, there was an advantage to these phone trees — they were contained. There were only so many paths a conversation could take, and developers could easily implement guardrails to disregard disallowed inputs. This constraint underpins the pros and cons of LLMs: They expand dramatically past the limited nature of phone trees, but they are also unpredictable, opening a Pandora’s box of pitfalls — such as making impossible promises, getting angry with customers, or breaching sensitive data.
## The Default Gaps
If LLMs are simply trained on a handbook originally designed for humans, they’ll have mediocre success due to a few core gaps. Understanding these gaps will help you design prompts to address them:
### Tone Mismatch
LLMs are trained via reinforcement learning, where human feedback incentivizes LLMs to return structured feedback. Specifically, LLM responses tend to be verbose and filled with bullets, call-out blocks, and headlines.
However, in the context of conversational AI, LLMs need to emulate the concise and flattened nature of verbal interactions.
### Assumption Gaps
LLMs have a tendency to fill any unknowns with inferred knowledge instead of asking questions. This can lead them to make incorrect assumptions that’ll mislead users—or lead to costly mistakes (e.g., promised refunds). Later, we’ll see how we can use a knowledge base and guardrails to better ground the LLMs from making incorrect promises and executing disallowed actions.
### Latency
LLMs can programmatically invoke function calls, gathering and writing data on behalf of humans. While this is generally one of the biggest advantages of LLMs, it also means that previous training instructions, which allowed call agents to “buy time” while performing tasks, are no longer needed. However, function calls aren’t instantaneous either, meaning that LLMs need to accurately forewarn the user whenever a delay is expected (e.g., “give me a moment to examine your case”).
## Configurations
### Personality
LLMs are fairly successful at augmenting tone to match a style. An LLM could be configured to sound friendly, humorous, concise, formal, or a combination of styles. This is an important input when prompting an LLM.
For example, developers of a customer service conversational AI application designed to support disgruntled airline customers might use a prompt such as:
You are a friendly customer service agent who speaks in concise, clear, empathetic sentences. 
American
Whispering
Mysterious
Gaming
Lively
Irish
Soothing
Audiobook
Nicole
### Format
LLMs need to receive explicit directions on how to respond. To ensure they don’t include additional padder text, LLMs should be provided a structure that encapsulates the response passed to the user.
For example, LLMs might be prompted to:
Respond exclusively with the string that should be read aloud to the user 
This scaffolding encourages the LLM to provide a response designed to be spoken aloud.
However, LLMs can sometimes stumble on things that might not intuitively differ from written content. A common example is numbers — an LLM might print out a zipcode like 10023, which will cause the [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) model to say, “ten thousand and twenty-three.” Instead, the LLM should be explicitly prompted to say the numbers individually, signposting what the numbers signify, e.g., “The zipcode is one zero zero two three.”
### Temperature
Temperature is a critical parameter when configuring LLMs for conversational AI. A lower temperature produces more focused, deterministic responses ideal for task-oriented conversations, while higher temperatures create more creative, varied responses.
A low temperature is ideal for conversational AI systems that might prefer consistent responses (e.g., a customer service line for refunds). Meanwhile, for systems that want to provide a more engaging and _realistic_ feel to customers (e.g., a digital coach), a high temperature is better:
Low Temperature: Thank you for calling ElevenLabs support. How can I help you?  
High Temperature: Hey hey! You've landed at ElevenLabs support—ready to tackle your tech troubles! What's on your mind? 
### Knowledge Bases
For conversational AI systems that tap into larger reservoirs of knowledge, a knowledge base should be leveraged to minimize the prompt’s length. In production, this is typically accomplished via a vector database (such as Pinecone or Elasticsearch) or the LLM provider’s direct knowledge store.
Generally speaking, knowledge bases are essential for grounding LLM responses in factual, approved information. When building a conversational AI system, you should provide the LLM with a comprehensive knowledge base that contains accurate, up-to-date information about products, services, policies, and procedures. This prevents the LLM from hallucinating or making up information while encouraging consistent and reliable responses across conversations.
### Process
Because LLMs often invoke functions on behalf of the user, they also need to know what inputs are explicitly needed. For example, if an LLM’s job is to help a user schedule a haircut appointment, they’ll need to ensure that they have:
  1. The user’s name
  2. The desired date and time
  3. The user’s address
  4. The user’s service preference
A naive implementation might result in the LLM asking for all of the information in one turn of the conversation. This is perfectly fine as text, but in a conversation, it can be overwhelming:
Support Agent: Could you please provide me with your name, your address, when you'd like your service to be, and what service you'd like?  
Customer: My name is Mathew and anytime Wednesday afternoon works. What else did you ask for? 
Because information is usually gathered incrementally via conversation, LLMs must be encouraged to fetch this information in a piecemeal fashion. The result is a much more conversational experience:
Support Agent: Could you please provide me with your name?  
Customer: My name is Mathew Pregasen.  
Support Agent: Thanks Mathew. When would you like to make an appointment?  
Customer: Anytime on Wednesday afternoon works fine.  
Support Agent: Great. Now can I get your address to find the nearest location?  
Customer: 555 West Main Street  
Support Agent: Perfect. Now what service are you look for?  
Customer: I'm looking for a haircut and if you could also do my beard that would be great! 
## Guardrails
### Permissions
When building distributed systems, you make an assumption that your server will crash at some point. Likewise, when building AI systems, you should assume that your LLM will make a mistake at some point. To minimize the blast radius of that mistake, you should give these systems the lowest permissions necessary for the job at hand. Below are some examples of ways you can do this:
  * Correctly set read/write permissions: If the LLM only needs to read information from a data source, make sure it’s given a read-only endpoint.
  * Limit access to API endpoints: If the LLM only needs access to certain endpoints, make sure it can’t access any others.
  * Human-in-the-loop escalations: If a high-risk action needs to be taken, consider a human-in-the-loop workflow that requires “manager approval” before executing the action.
### Validation and Verification
When creating conversation AI systems that take actions through tool use, it’s helpful to build in a validation-and-verification process to ensure you’re collecting the correct information from users. Today, when you talk to a human agent, they’ll repeat any critical information you give to verify they heard it correctly and that the customer didn’t misspeak. LLMs could benefit from a similar level of error-checking:
Support Agent: Great. Now can I get your address to find the nearest location?  
Customer: 555 West Main Street  
Support Agent: I got five five five west main street. Did I miss anything? 
For validation, any information received from the customer should be checked against the typical structure of that information. Does the phone number have the correct number of digits? Does the age given by the customer fall within a reasonable range? Did the customer provide a valid address?
Support Agent: What would a good callback number be for you?  
Customer: 317-798-97289  
Support Agent: I think I might have misheard you. I heard 11 numbers. Would you mind repeating that again? 
Depending on your use case, you can verify all information received or only information that failed verification. Additionally, you can decide to verify each piece of information as it comes in or verify everything at the end.
## A Closing Thought
Successfully prompting a conversational AI system involves balancing the right configurations and guardrails to generate an experience that emulates talking to a human with heightened efficiency. The process isn’t as trivial as using old training materials to prompt an LLM; instead, LLMs are tools that need specialized structure and strategy to create predictable, effective results.

You enter a dimly lit tavern. A cloaked figure leans in, voice low and urgent. "You're being watched," they whisper. But this isn’t a voice actor speaking—it's AI. 
This is the future of [interactive storytelling](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/the-future-of-ai-storytelling). Thanks to [AI-generated voices](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-create-video-game-characters-npcs-voices), characters in choose-your-own-adventure games no longer rely on silent text or static recordings. Instead, they speak—changing tone, adapting to player choices, and making every interaction feel alive.
In this article, we’ll explore how AI voice technology (such as ElevenLabs' [Text-to-Speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech)) is changing the way stories are told, giving creators the power to bring their worlds to life without the time and cost of traditional voice acting.
## What is interactive storytelling?
Stories used to be one-way. You read, listened, or watched. No control. No choices. Interactive storytelling changes that.
Interactive storytelling blends traditional storytelling with audience participation, allowing users to influence the narrative. Instead of passively consuming a story, the audience makes choices that shape events, characters, and outcomes. Every decision matters. Choose a path, change the outcome. The narrative bends to the player’s will—it's dictated by user input.
This format is exploding in popularity. Why? Because passive entertainment is fading. Players want to engage. They want control, and they want stories that adapt to them. With [AI-driven tools](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/best-ai-video-game-tools), interactive storytelling is evolving fast—becoming more responsive, more immersive, and more alive than ever before.
Nowhere is this more obvious than in choose-your-own-adventure games. These games thrive on player choices, branching storylines, and dynamic dialogue. And with AI-generated voices, they’re becoming even more lifelike. Imagine an NPC that doesn’t just deliver pre-recorded lines but responds in real time, adapting tone and emotion based on your actions. That’s where we’re headed. And it’s just the beginning.
## **The impact of Voice AI**
AI-generated voices are revolutionizing interactive storytelling. No more silent text boxes or static narration. Now, characters speak, react, and evolve—all without the constraints of traditional voice acting.
### Bringing characters to life
A hero’s confidence. A villain’s menace. An NPC’s nervous stammer. AI voices give characters personality. And because they’re not locked to pre-recorded lines, dialogue can shift dynamically, adapting to player choices and story paths. Every interaction feels more fluid, more natural—it feels more alive.
### Creating dynamic dialogue in real time
Branching storylines are great. But without voice, they can feel flat. AI-generated speech fixes that. Whether in a CYOA game, mobile app, or RPG, AI lets dialogue respond to player actions instantly—without needing thousands of pre-recorded lines. This means richer conversations, more varied responses, and truly immersive NPC interactions.
### Speeding up game development
Traditional voice acting takes time—hiring actors, recording lines, editing audio. AI cuts that development time drastically. Need to tweak a character’s tone? Fine-tune it instantly. Expanding a branching storyline? Generate new dialogue on the fly. AI doesn’t replace human voice actors, but it gives creators more flexibility than ever before.
### Making interactive stories more accessible
Not every player wants to read walls of text—some prefer to listen. AI-generated voices open up story-based games to a wider audience, making them more inclusive for kids, students, and players of all ages. Add multiple language options, and suddenly, your game or story can reach the world.
Voice AI isn’t just enhancing storytelling—it’s transforming it. Players expect richer worlds, deeper characters, and more responsive narratives. With AI voices, creators can finally deliver.
## What developers should look for in a voice AI provider
Not all AI voice tools are created equal. For interactive storytelling and CYOA games, you need more than just text-to-speech—you need voices that feel real, react naturally, and adapt to the player’s choices. A good AI voice provider doesn’t just generate speech; it enhances the entire storytelling experience.
When choosing a provider, here’s what to look for:
  * **Natural, expressive voices** **–** AI-generated voices should sound human, capturing tone, pacing, and emotion. Flat, robotic speech kills immersion. Look for a provider with advanced AI models that produce dynamic, lifelike performances.
  * **Real-time voice generation –** Interactive stories evolve in real time. Your AI tool should generate speech instantly, adapting to player choices without lag or pre-rendering.
  * **Customization and fine-tuning –** Different characters need different personalities. The right AI tool lets you fine-tune voices to match tone, age, emotion, and speaking style—without starting from scratch.
  * **Scalability for branching dialogue –** A CYOA game may have hundreds of story paths. A strong AI provider scales effortlessly, generating new voice lines without costly recording sessions.
  * **Multilingual support –** Players around the world want immersive experiences in their own language. A top-tier provider should offer high-quality voice generation across multiple languages and accents.
  * **Seamless integration –** The best AI-driven solutions fit right into your game design workflow. Whether you’re using mobile apps, game engines, or interactive fiction platforms, your AI voice provider should have intuitive integration capabilities.
  * **User-friendly interface –** A complex system slows down creativity. Look for an intuitive interface that makes it easy to generate, test, and tweak voice performances.
ElevenLabs checks all these boxes, offering high-quality AI voices that adapt to player input, scale with your project, and bring interactive narratives to life. The right provider doesn’t just generate sound—it elevates the entire storytelling experience.

# Our Impact Program aims to empower 1 million people through AI voice technology
Aug 20, 2024 • 5 minutes reading time
We're partnering with Bridging Voice and The Scott-Morgan Foundation to provide free licenses to all ALS/MND patients worldwide
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fk4thk2cqps-Impact%20Launch.webp&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fzzehvouhzco-ElevenLabs%20X%20Topview%20Blog%20Cover%201x1.webp&w=3840&q=95)
We're joining forces with [ text-to-speech ](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech)technology to ALS/MND patients who have lost or are at risk of losing their ability to speak. Bridging Voice and The Scott-Morgan Foundation will provide dedicated support to ensure everyone can get onboarded and take advantage of the technology. 
According to recent statistics:
  * In the United States, approximately 30,000 people are living with ALS at any given time.
  * Worldwide, it is estimated that over 300,000 people are living with ALS/MND.
  * Up to 95% of people with ALS/MND may lose their ability to speak as the disease progresses.
By partnering with Bridging Voice and The Scott-Morgan Foundation, we can distribute ElevenLabs voices to ALS and MND patients at scale and integrate them into speech-generating devices.
The initiative will work as follows:
  1. ALS and MND patients will be able to apply for a free voice cloning license by visiting our partner sites. Fill out this form to be connected to the best organization for your needs: [elevenlabs.io/impact-program](https://elevenlabs.io/impact-program)
  2. Eligible patients will provide voice recordings, which will be used to create a digital replica of their voice.
  3. The voice clone can then be used from the ElevenLabs platform and with various assistive communication devices and software, allowing patients to "speak" in their own voice. 
Tim Green, a former NFL lineman for the Atlanta Falcons and sports broadcaster, was diagnosed with ALS in 2016 and later lost his ability to speak. Through the support of Bridging Voice, he created a voice replica on ElevenLabs with old recordings that he now uses for his podcast, “Nothing Left Unsaid”. 
Tim said:
"When my family first heard MY voice again, they cried. I couldn't stop smiling. When we were negotiating our podcast sponsorship agreement with ElevenLabs, it was important to try to give as many people their voices back as possible. ElevenLabs was extremely generous and wanted to help.
By partnering with Bridging Voice, ElevenLabs is going to be able to help exactly the people who will benefit the most from their compassion. These are the two groups I personally work closely with and would recommend them to anyone who has lost their voice."
Erin Taylor, a 24-year-old botany graduate diagnosed with ALS in August 2023, has become a 
“Over last year, we couldn't be more inspired by the individuals that are reclaiming their voices despite all the challenges and our opportunity to help play a small part in that process. Now, through the incredible partnerships and support of Bridging Voice and The Scott-Morgan Foundation, these efforts are being taken to a new level. We’re honored to be part of this collective mission of empowering people and helping remove communication barriers.”
-Mati Staniszewski, Co-founder and CEO of ElevenLabs.
"By democratizing access to ElevenLabs' hyper-realistic voice technology, we're not just improving communication for those with ALS/MND – we're restoring dignity and empowering individuals to fully express themselves. This is more than technology; it's about preserving identity and human connection." LaVonne Roberts, Executive Director at The Scott-Morgan Foundation. 
"Communication with loved ones and the world is at the heart of what it means to be human. No diagnosis should ever strip that away. This partnership isn’t just about giving a voice to those living with ALS/MND—it’s about helping them rediscover their voice. It’s a reminder that their unique voice, full of love and strength, will always be heard." -Karina Nagin, Executive Director at Bridging Voice. 
We hope by preserving their unique voices, we can help maintain a crucial aspect of patients' identities and facilitate more natural communication with loved ones and caregivers.

We build AI to help people communicate. Through our [**Impact Program**](https://elevenlabs.io/impact-program), we provide free access to those who need it most. Last year, we started by supporting ALS patients. Now, we’re expanding to include people affected by Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and mouth cancers.
We’ve partnered with 
##### How it works
  * MSA Trust & Mission MSA: verified MSA patients get free lifetime access to ElevenLabs’ AI voice tools to create and use digital voice replicas.
  * Mouth Cancer Foundation: patients in the UK diagnosed with oral and head and neck cancers can apply for a free Pro plan, letting them clone their voice before speech loss.
Losing the ability to speak is deeply isolating. AI voice technology gives people a way to keep their voice, making communication feel familiar and natural. That’s why we’re committed to helping 1 million people through the Impact Program. If your non-profit could benefit from AI advancements, [reach out to us](https://elevenlabs.io/impact-partners).

Last week at the   
Alongside ElevenLabs, the panel included leaders from the Alan Turing Institute, the Ada Lovelace Institute, and BT, with MIT Technology Review’s Melissa Heikkilä moderating the discussion.
#### Three-pronged approach to AI safety
At ElevenLabs, we develop audio AI technology conscious of its impact. In my role overseeing AI Safety, I’m focused on empowering creators, businesses and users, while preventing misuse and deterring bad actors. During the panel, I outlined the steps we’ve taken to make ElevenLabs a safer, more innovative space, and I advocated for the adoption of strategies that prioritize addressing AI safety challenges. These strategies include:
**Provenance** : involves distinguishing AI-generated content from real content by understanding its origins. Upstream AI detection tools, such as classifiers, are probabilistic models trained to recognize AI-generated outputs. At ElevenLabs, we’ve developed the AI Speech Classifier that lets anyone upload samples to check if they originate from our platform. We’re also collaborating with Loccus to enhance AI content classification capabilities. Classifiers, however, are not a panacea solution for provenance; they have their limitations. To address them, downstream AI detection methods have emerged, including metadata, watermarks, and fingerprinting solutions. We endorse industry-wide efforts such as cryptographically signed metadata standard 
**Traceability:** ensures that AI-generated content can be traced back to an individual user. At ElevenLabs, our systems let us link content generated on our platform to the originating account, and our voice cloning tools are accessible only to users who have verified their accounts with banking information. Focus on traceability ensures that anyone using AI platforms can be accountable for their actions, and identified by legal authorities when necessary.
**Moderation** : which involves defining clear policies on acceptable content and use, and preventing users from generating content that does not comply with such policies. At ElevenLabs, we use automated systems to scan, flag, and block inappropriate content. Human moderators review flagged content to ensure consistent policy enforcement. We are continually advancing our moderation technology to prevent the generation of content that could harm public trust or safety. Open source moderation endpoints, such as the one provided by 
#### Working together towards a common goal
While we prioritize safe AI development, no company can tackle AI misuse alone. At the panel, we recognized the need for widespread collaboration among tech companies, governments, civil rights groups, and the public to confront social and environmental changes and ensure a secure digital future. At ElevenLabs, we’re dedicated to maintaining open dialogue in our community and supporting initiatives like the [Elections Safety Accord](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/elevenlabs-signs-tech-accord-on-election-safety) to combat [misinformation](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-elevenlabs-is-preparing-for-elections-in-2024).
#### Future-proofing AI safety
At the panel, we all agreed that AI products must be developed and used safely. At the same time we must also allow their creative and unexpected uses. At ElevenLabs, we often see our platform used to improve accessibility of digital content for individuals in need of audio transcriptions, and to give voices back to those who have lost them due to ALS and other health conditions. To make AI applications thrive, it is essential to raise awareness about AI media, encourage critical interaction with digital content, promote tools for verifying authenticity, and educate both the public and institutions on ethical AI usage.

At its best, generative AI can boost human productivity, creativity and wellbeing. At ElevenLabs, we believe in the transformative potential of these technologies but we also recognize that to fully harness their benefits, we must ensure their safe and responsible use. We're now launching the Classifier to help prevent the spread of misinformation by making the source of audio content easier to assess. Test it yourself:
[AI Speech Classifier](https://elevenlabs.io/)[AI Safety at ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/safety)
### Transparency over AI-generated content
The Classifier allows anyone to upload a sample and analyze whether it contains AI audio from ElevenLabs. It's the first proprietary mechanism of its kind in the audio space and it is a critical step in our mission to develop efficient tracking for AI-generated media. With today’s launch, we seek to further reinforce our commitment to transparency around 
### Mechanism and known limitations
Audio generated by our models has certain detectable characteristics. When you upload an audio sample to the AI Speech Classifier, our algorithm will scan for them to assess whether the content was indeed generated by our platform, currently maintaining >99% accuracy if the input was unmodified. If it underwent Codec or reverb transformations, the Classifier is over 90% accurate. This figure drops the more the content has been post-processed. Adding more audio tracks will also affect the result.
We are continuously analyzing and improving our model to be able to detect more audio transformations and we expect these outcomes to improve.
### Call for input
We are releasing the Classifier publicly today to foster AI detection initiatives. We want to enhance transparency over AI-generated content by starting with our own. A plethora of AI content from other commercial and open-source models remains undetected. We encourage others to join our effort, and we encourage [reporting suspected cases](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_13297797982993=report_content) as we continue to improve the Classifier’s accuracy and detection capabilities to cover more audio transformations, as well as content generated on other platforms, including both commercial and open-source models. We are eager to collaborate with interested partners on deeper API integration and enhancing the value of this tool.
### A commitment to transparency
Our goal at ElevenLabs is to produce safe tools that can create remarkable content. We believe that our status as an organization gives us the ability to build and enforce safeguards which are often lacking in open source models. With the AI Speech Classifier launch we also aim to empower businesses and institutions to leverage our research and technology to bolster their respective safeguards.

Expanding japanese skateboarding culture with multilingual Voice AI
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F7v3t6qqwygc-Decagon%20Blog%20Cover.webp&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fd7u8kygoen-Decagon%20Blog%201x1.webp&w=3840&q=95)
Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), one of Japan’s leading media companies, has been producing high-quality television and radio content since 1951. With a growing focus on digital platforms, TBS has been expanding its global reach - bringing original content to audiences worldwide.
One of its standout projects is KASSO, a series that dives into Japan’s skateboarding culture. It features top skateboarders, dynamic street sessions, and competitions while weaving in music, fashion, and art. As skateboarding gained international attention, TBS saw an opportunity to bring KASSO to a wider audience. To prepare for Season 2, they decided to dub Season 1 into English, Spanish, and Portuguese - making the series more accessible while setting the stage for global expansion.
##### Dubbing at scale with AI
Traditional dubbing is time and labor-intensive, and often loses the original emotion and nuance of the speaker. Finding multilingual voice actors who can match the energy of the original performances is also a challenge.
TBS used our AI Dubbing to solve these challenges. Our technology captures vocal tone, emotion, and natural expression across languages while cutting production time. KASSO stays true to the original in every language, reaching more viewers without the usual hurdles of dubbing.
TBS plans to bring KASSO to more languages, making Japanese skateboarding culture easier to follow worldwide. Expanding its reach means growing the global fan base and building a stronger presence beyond Japan. With natural AI dubbing, viewers can watch KASSO in their own language without losing the energy or style of the original. It’s part of a broader push to make Japanese content more accessible, without the usual barriers of translation.
_“We expect ElevenLabs’ AI Dubbing technology to drive the global expansion of KASSO and unlock new possibilities for future TBS content,”_ says Takumi Watanabe, Manager, New IP Development._“Rapid, high-quality multilingual production will help us engage audiences in new ways and strengthen our position in the global content market.”_
With AI-powered localization, TBS is ensuring that KASSO viewers worldwide can experience the energy, emotion, and authenticity of Japan’s skateboarding scene in their own language.

Kindroid creates engaging AI companions with ElevenLabs voices
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fss8ihz3dces-kindroid-desktop.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Ff4w9lz9vpur-kind3.png&w=3840&q=95)
Kindroid, an AI character company, lets users create customizable, multimodal AI companions. Kindroid uses ElevenLabs to power their voices.
Kindroid users can personalize their companion avatars by providing a unique backstory and key memories. Your Kindroid continues to improve over time as it gets to know you better - furthering the connection between users and their companion. Our collaboration introduces human-like, customizable voices to Kindroid, enhancing real-time conversations through a more immersive experience.
This integration has contributed to Kindroid becoming the fastest-growing community among AI virtual companion applications. The average user spends more than 90 minutes a day with their Kindroid and over a half a million people have tried the app.
Jerry Meng, Kindroid's Founder & CEO, had this to say:
“Kindroid chose Elevenlabs as our audio provider for their dedication to uncompromising quality voices to power Kindroid's virtual people. Elevenlabs made it fun and engaging for users to converse with their AIs over voice, and at the same time has saved us time and cost from self-hosting the voice inference at our scale. Kindroid users have listened to thousands of hours of voices over a few months, and we look forward to building more voice-first features within the app to bring great voice AI to end consumers with Elevenlabs.”

# How USA Today bestselling author Leeanna Morgan uses ElevenLabs to increase audiobook sales
Apr 30, 2024 • 4 minutes reading time
Leeanna’s love for writing and storytelling led her to publish 44 bestselling contemporary romance novels. Now, she uses ElevenLabs AI narration to turn her novels into audiobooks.

## Meet Leeanna Morgan
Leeanna is a successful writer and online businesswoman based in New Zealand. With a repertoire of over 44 published novels and a regular readership well into the tens of thousands, Leeanna is passionate about sharing stories and making her work accessible to her readers.
Audiobooks were always on her radar when Leeanna started publishing her novels in 2014. As a self-published author, Leeanna always looks for new ways to expand her audience and reach new readers, so selling audiobooks alongside her print works appealed to her. 
Plus, Leeanna is passionate about helping more people understand the power of stories, and audio narration is a fantastic way to make content more accessible.
## The power of AI narration
When Leeanna first investigated the cost of publishing an audiobook, she was shocked to find that the going rate for recording was around NZ $7,000 (approximately USD 4,000). 
At such a high cost, Leeanna would need huge sales volumes just to break even. That meant offering audiobooks was not possible, as the initial cost of creating them was just too high. 
On top of the high costs, the average human-read audiobook has a turnaround time of over a month. Longer books can take even longer. In today’s fast-paced world of BookTok and Bookstagram, that wasn’t good enough for Leeanna’s readers.
All that was until Leeanna heard another author talk about how they used ElevenLabs to generate human-sounding, authentic audiobooks in a fraction of the time. Leeanna says:
“I’d tried other AI software, but the dialogue was always substandard and I wasn’t prepared to sell anything less than amazing to my readers. As soon as I tried a sample of dialogue on ElevenLabs, I knew I’d found the perfect solution to creating high-quality [AI audiobook narration.](https://elevenlabs.io/use-cases/audiobooks)”
## How ElevenLabs changes the audiobook game
Now, Leeanna has created 21 audiobooks already and, by her own estimates, has saved over NZ $147,000 in recording, editing, and publishing costs! 
She uses ElevenLabs text-to-speech functionality to create her [AI audiobooks](https://elevenlabs.io/use-cases/audiobooks) and can configure critical elements of the narration to enhance her plot, including accent, gender, and reading speed.
She says: “I can create an entire series of audiobooks when I want them. It’s much faster to edit the AI narration, and I can fine-tune the speech exactly how I want it to sound. I can even use multiple voices and add sound effects if I want to. ElevenLabs is a mini movie set on my desktop!”
Plus, Leeanna finds ElevenLabs so easy to use that she’s even got her mom involved in the editing process, explaining:
“I now pay my mom to edit the audio files. It takes 30-45 minutes to fully edit each chapter, and I usually have about 70 chapters per book. If I were contracting a human narrator to create my audiobooks, I’d still have to listen to the entire book and write down any changes I wanted, so the additional time to edit an AI-narrated audiobook is well worth it. Especially when I know the books sound incredible.” 
Ultimately, without ElevenLabs, Leeanna’s readers would have been unable to listen to her work through their headphones or on the go. The power of the ElevenLabs technology has also meant that Leeanna can benefit from a new income stream, and she has seen her sales increase as a result.
**“ElevenLabs has brought my books to life, increased the number of people discovering my stories, and increased my sales! It’s perfect for anyone wanting to create high-quality AI-narrated audiobooks.”**
## Making AI audiobooks accessible to authors
But that’s not the end of Leeanna’s story with ElevenLabs. 
After her experience, she knew that so many more authors could benefit from AI narration. She surmised that many authors were reluctant to try AI voiceovers out as they didn’t know it was an option, felt intimidated by the creation process, or didn’t know how [AI audiobooks](https://elevenlabs.io/use-cases/audiobooks) can add to their income stream.
As a result, Leeanna started work on her course, 
Her step-by-step course covers her entire process, from formatting and editing your manuscript to creating audio samples for your website. With 13 modules, 3.5 hours of detailed video instruction, and eight downloadable PDFs, Leeanna shares her secrets with authors online.

Erin Taylor, a disability advocate with ALS, introduced Lenovo’s Chairman at the event using this technology. Speaking with her own voice again, she said what matters most is seeing this tool help others in similar situations.
In the past, voice banking could be slow and often lacked emotional depth. Now, with voice AI, we can recreate voices that capture the speaker’s unique tone and character, helping them keep their personal identity. We’re working closely with SMF and

This work continues the legacy of Dr. Peter Scott-Morgan, who believed that technology could remove the barriers faced by people with severe disabilities. Thanks to recent advances, this vision is becoming real.
SMF will keep testing and improving the tool to meet the real needs of people with ALS. We’re proud to be building technology that makes a real difference on a deeply human level.

We just opened a new office in London, making it our European HQ and center for worldwide operations. London is the perfect place for our next phase of growth, with the capital combining cultural diversity, access to talent and innovation, as well as proximity to other tech hubs.
London and the UK have been a key part of our story since the inception in 2022. Our co-founders, Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dabkowski, attended UK universities and started their careers in the capital before launching the company. London has become our largest employee hub, with over 20 people already based there and we expect this to grow to over 100. 
With more than 300 languages spoken across London, combined with the capital’s status as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and deep pool of technical talent, the city will provide an ideal base for ElevenLabs to further our mission to break down the language and accessibility barriers of digital content. 
ElevenLabs remains a remote-first, global company with talent spread across over 15 countries throughout Europe, Asia, and North America. Recognizing that top AI research talent can come from anywhere, the company welcomes team members from any location. We're opening physical hubs for those who prefer to work in person, starting with the London office, soon to be followed by new spaces set to open in New York and Warsaw. 
**Mati Staniszewski, CEO and co-founder of ElevenLabs, said:**
> We can't think of a better place to open our central hub. My co-founder Piotr and I came to the UK to study over 10 years ago, and we're continuously inspired by the people and the plethora of opportunities available. From AI safety to AI innovation, we're excited to contribute to this vibrant ecosystem. As we build an international team spanning many countries, we're happy to find a location that reflects our company's culture while staying globally well-connected.
#### **Space set to foster local talent**
The new office, located on Wardour Street, will accommodate our 20 current London-based team members, with plans to expand this to 40 within the next 6 months and 100 within the coming years. 
In addition to hosting our team, we're also opening an incubator-style space in the building for London-based startups and creatives that are incorporating AI audio into their work. Startups can apply for ElevenLabs credits, free office space, and access to community events [here](https://elevenlabs.io/startup-grants).
#### **Support from London & Partners**
We've been engaging with London & Partners, the business and destination agency for the capital, to foster inclusive, sustainable growth of the business in Europe and engage with the thriving AI community based in London.
According to London & Partners data, over three-quarters (77%) of international business leaders say London is the most supportive hub for developing AI compared to other major AI hubs. Nearly half (45%) cited supportive government incentives & policies tailored for AI development as London’s key advantage.
**Janet Coyle CBE, Managing Director of Grow London at London & Partners, said: **
> The fact that we have incredibly innovative companies like ElevenLabs choosing London for its European headquarters is not only a testament to the city’s thriving ecosystem but also to our solid AI credentials. Our research shows that over three-quarters (77%) of decision makers at international AI companies consider London to be more supportive of AI development than other major AI hubs. We’re thrilled to have ElevenLabs join us here and play an important part in developing the technology of tomorrow.

# Luka Dončić's AI version powered by ElevenLabs voice technology
Jul 13, 2023 • 2 minutes reading time
The AI voice, dubbed Luk.AI, helps 77x World generate new types of media and entertainment experiences with brands and fans around the world. 
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fnqroj7s150f-luka-doncic-desktop.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fmlq19tk8lw8-luka-doncic-mobile.jpg&w=3840&q=95)
Luka Dončić is amongst the top 20 best players in the NBA for the past 50 years. In his mid-20s, Luka is not only an offensive prodigy but also one of the most recognisable basketball players in the NBA. The Slovenian player has been at the NBA for the past 4 seasons and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.
Being at the top of the rankings and delivering results on the basketball court is physically draining. Keeping a close relationship with fans and brands is an even larger undertaking. Nevertheless, technology has evolved fast over the past 12 months to help athletes do more with less.
Luka's 77x World production company and ElevenLabs signed a partnership to recreate Luka's voice in high quality and fully reproduce his speaking style, pacing, accent and delivery. The AI voice, dubbed Luk.AI, helps 77x World generate new types of media and entertainment experiences with brands and fans around the world. The AI voice developed by ElevenLabs is able to natively speak any language ElevenLabs supports which opens the possibilities to reach more fans globally.
An example of it is the recently unveiled campaign with Nike's Jordan brand to launch the new signature sneaker Luka2. ElevenLabs provided the AI voice while the alter ego was developed by Epic Games.
ElevenLabs' breakthrough technology offers a set of benefits for Luka and his production studio:
  * **Brand engagement:** Generating content for brands takes seconds instead of hours and recording studios. The content can be iterated as much as needed to get the right messages.
  * **Hyper-personalised campaigns:** Personalisation of marketing content to appeal to different audiences is now possible with dynamic and branching narratives.
  * **Fan interaction:** Interacting with fans through new forms is now possible. From chatbots to personalised messages. AI voices expand use cases for athletes and celebrities.
  * **Content localisation:** ElevenLabs' voice technology is multilingual by nature. This means that content can be generated across any language, current or future, that is supported while preserving Luka's unique voice likeness.

# Lumiere Ventures and ElevenLabs collaborate to honor Alain Dorval in Sylvester Stallone’s new film
Jan 13, 2025 • 3 minutes reading time
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fsuh069jb8bg-91.webp&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F45fysap796w-91.webp&w=3840&q=95)
We’re collaborating with _Armored_ , set to premiere on Amazon France in March 2025.
When Lumiere acquired the French rights to the film, they faced a challenge: how to preserve the connection audiences had with Stallone’s voice after Dorval’s passing. The dubbing was completed with a new actor, but they approached us to explore another option - using AI to recreate Dorval’s voice. Together with Dorval’s family, we worked to transform the recording, preserving the voice French audiences know and love.
The project is still underway, with edits continuing ahead of the film’s March 2025 release. A French dub already exists with a different actor, but recreating Alain Dorval's voice is a tribute to his decades-long role as Stallone's voice. Supporting this mission, Dorval's family has partnered with the filmmakers at no cost to help preserve his impact on French cinema. Together with Lumiere and Dorval’s estate, we’ve agreed that if the quality bar isn't met, the film will be released with traditional dubbing - the family retains full control and will decide if and how this AI dub is used.
This marks the first time our technology is being used in a major motion picture. For us, it’s about showing how AI can support storytelling by respecting artistry and tradition. Recreating Dorval’s voice is a way to preserve what’s meaningful to audiences while creating new opportunities in film. It also marks a symbolic occasion for us: We founded ElevenLabs to let stories reach audiences in their native languages without losing the emotion and nuance that make them resonate.
_“AI doesn’t replace the magic of human creativity—it opens new doors for it,”_ said Mati Staniszewski, CEO of ElevenLabs. _“Recreating Alain Dorval’s voice is a chance to show how technology can honor tradition while creating new possibilities in film production.”_
Lumiere Ventures specializes in bringing high-profile Hollywood content to international audiences. _Armored_ shows a fresh approach to foreign-language cinema. AI dubbing lets more people enjoy films in their native languages. Our partnership aims to make great Hollywood films more accessible across regions and languages, allowing filmmakers and distributors to meet growing global demand for localized content, without compromising quality or cultural connection.

# Magicave announces Beneath The Six, a turn-based roguelike game with an AI narrator developed in collaboration with ElevenLabs and Tom Canton from Netflix’s hit show The Witcher

**London, July 6, 2023 -** Magicave, the UK-based game studio, today announced _Beneath The Six_ , a single and multiplayer turn-based roguelike game. 
_Beneath The Six_ blends exploration and discovery with character progression, magic and combat. Players combine beautiful, collectible, digital dice to create unique characters whose appearance and skills are based on the dice’s traits - a character cast from wizard dice will have strong magic powers; adding in some warrior dice may add weapon skills and strength to the mix.
Magicave and generative voice pioneers ElevenLabs have partnered to develop an in-game AI narrator in collaboration with actor Tom Canton, known for his role as Filavandrel, King of the Elves in Netflix’s hit TV show _The Witcher._
Coupling innovative procedural dungeon and character generation with Canton’s AI narration enables _Beneath The Six_ to generate a new world every day and, ultimately, to create unique worlds for individual players to explore, curate and challenge their friends. ElevenLabs CEO Mati Staniszewski commented “Our collaboration with Magicave and Tom Canton on _Beneath The Six_ demonstrates how AI technology can unlock new game experiences which players have never seen, or heard, before.”
“Generative AI opens up gameplay possibilities we’re excited to explore,” added Ste Curran, Magicave’s Creative Director, “But you can’t explore them without the support of the creatives that make the work possible in the first place. We’ve read stories of actors being forced to sign agreements assigning their AI voice IP to game and tech companies - robbing them of future opportunities and literally taking their voice away. We want to build the future, but we also want a company that aligns with our values, so we’ve come up with a new business model we feel works for everyone.”
Both Magicave and ElevenLabs have a commitment to ensuring the rights of voice actors are protected. Magicave has assigned ownership of the AI voice to Tom Canton, licensing it from him for use in the game, while allowing him the freedom to use his AI voice in other media - whether games, voiceovers, animations, audiobooks or movies.
Beneath the Six is the first product in Magicave’s dNo® digital hobby franchise., Reminiscent of beloved pastimes like Warhammer or Dungeons & Dragons, dNo is based around beautiful, collectible digital dice, characters and worlds. The company is building in public - with regular public previews and streamed internal playtests available via the 
Those on the Discord will be given early access to test aspects of the game throughout the development process. The first public tests of aspects of _Beneath The Six_ will launch later this year. More information on the game and the dNo universe can be found

### About ElevenLabs
We're a voice technology research company developing world-leading text-to-speech software for publishers and creators. Our mission is to make content universally accessible.
ElevenLabs was founded by childhood friends Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dabkowski. Inspired by the ‘terrible’ dubbing of American movies they watched growing up in their native Poland, the pair set about designing a platform which could eliminate the linguistic barriers of content. 
ElevenLabs’ research teams have pioneered text-to-speech capabilities which focus on combining two novel approaches to ultra-realistic speech synthesis - context awareness and high compression.
The ElevenLabs model is able to understand the relations between words and to adjust delivery based on context (‘contextual’ text-to-speech). Because there are no hardcoded voice features in the model, it can robustly predict thousands of voice characteristics while generating AI voices.

[Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) to create fun and memorable interactions with members. Let’s see KUBI in action.
## How KUBI works
KUBI employs a sophisticated multi-sensory architecture to simulate human-like interaction. The system hinges on a microservices architecture, where specialized services operate concurrently and communicate via a real-time event stream. These services manage various tasks, including facial and object recognition using real-time AI inference, cup detection and sanity checks via cameras, receipt printing, secure facial recognition for access control, and precise control of milk and bean dispensers.
These are some of the services that are running concurrently:
  * **Environment** **Camera Service** : Uses real-time AI inference (PyTorch in Python) to spot faces and objects.
  * **Tablet** **Camera Service** : Very similar, but detects cups on the table, and foreign objects and verifies sanity - such as, if KUBI robot is actually holding a cup.
  * **Receipt Printing Service** : Simple and reliable with Node + Typescript. Talks to an RS232 thermal printer.
  * **Payment Service** : Built with Kotlin JVM for solid concurrency and type safety. Handles government receipt reporting and communications with a credit card terminal, crypto payments gateway or online payments providers. 
  * **Milk & Bean Dispensers**: Separate precision services — Arduino. Time-sensitive, low latency.
  * **Facial Recognition** : Secure and strongly typed Kotlin Service, used for access control.
  * **Water Jet Service** : Automatically cleans milk steaming jugs after use — Arduino.
  * And various other services e.g. for mobile app API, menu display etc…
Why all these microservices? Easy — we manage them independently, scale easily, and use the best tools for each task.
## A central event-drive core to tie it all together
Coordinating all these micr-services is a central service, humorously called **"BigBoy"**. It’s essentially a giant, non-blocking event processor:
### Here's how BigBoy works:
  1. Listens to incoming events from all services.
  2. Checks scenarios for eligible triggers.
  3. Selects the best scenario.
  4. Schedules actions for playback.

**What are scenarios?**
Think of scenarios as non-blocking compilers for robot**action events**. An action event is usually the most downstream event, that is the last step in a chain, resulting in a physical effect, such as motion or speech. For instance, a greeting scenario might trigger:
SayEvent("Hello! Welcome!", wave.gif)  
MotionEvent(HelloMotion)
**Event Generation with LLM:** Some action events are automatically generated by an LLM, for example, `withAutoMotion` would pick the best motion from a pre-defined list based on the given context. While `withAutoGif` uses an LLM to generate the most suitable tag for the given phrase. The tag is used to get a GIF on Giphy, which will later be displayed on the face of KUBI together with the phrase.
**Synchronization of action events:** These events then flow through a scheduler that ensures speech, facial expressions, and motions stay synchronized. Synchronization ensures KUBI’s speech matches its gestures perfectly.
### **Flexible and Extendable**
The cool thing is, that scenarios can even listen to **action events** and trigger new **action events** dynamically. For example:
  * If BigBoy detects **SayEvent("Merry Christmas")** , it can automatically trigger festive lights and special effects in the room.
  * Another cool example is - if the user chooses our Mobile App to make an order, all user interactions (clicking on a product, making a payment etc) are converted into events and BigBoy can also react in real-time. For instance, if the user scrolls past “Oatmilk Latte”, KUBI might say “Are you sure you don’t want that Oatmilk Latte? It’s really good!”
BigBoy literally sees and knows everything going on. Pretty cool, huh?
### **DevOps and Observability**
Most of the services are hosted locally and are wrapped in a docker container. In the container, their lifecycle is managed by the Supervisor process control system. Error logs are collected in Sentry and are fed into a custom admin app to monitor any exceptions, real-time status of services and sensors as well as latency reportings. The cool thing is that the Flutter app was 90% generated by AI.
## Using ElevenLabs to create memorable interactions
Second Space had a very specific personality in mind for KUBI - a mixture of Deadpool, Wheatley from Portal game and a bit of Pathfinder from Apex Legends. They managed to [design the voice](http://elevenlabs.io/voice-design) in 15 minutes complete with emotions and pauses that make the voice even more human. 
ElevenLabs powers KUBI’s speech capabilities through two core APIs:
#### **Text-To-Speech (TTS)**
  * Handles ~90% of our interactions.
  * Uses pre-designed scenarios for the perfect vibe.
  * Messages generated by LLMs can be personalized, with high-quality audio, the best pronunciation, not time-critical.
  * Offers incredibly natural multilingual speech in English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, and even Latvian (Latvian Deadpool, anyone?).
#### **Conversational Mode (Real-Time)**
Activated when a customer says, _"Hey KUBI!"_ , Conversational AI from ElevenLabs is able to respond in **200ms** , making the interaction feel truly human-like.
  * Priority: **Low latency**.
  * Trades some audio quality for responsiveness.
  * Uses ElevenLabs' new real-time **language_detection** tool, dynamically handling different languages instantly.
  * Conversational AI session started on demand when a member enters the facility or says “Hey, KUBI!”
#### **Custom Conversational Tools**
Using ElevenLabs’ Conversational AI via WebSocket connection, KUBI can leverage function calling, for example: 
  * **make_order** : Recognizes orders, sends events directly into BigBoy.
  * **make_payment** : Immediately notifies our PaymentService to trigger the credit card machine for payments.
Switching between different LLM models easily through ElevenLabs' admin panel helps Second Space optimize understanding and accuracy, as we noticed that different models recognize the tool **intents** better than others. They are currently using Gemini 2.0 Flash to be their core model for Conversational AI and ChatGPT 4o for the static speech generations.
## Expanding KUBI to additional markets
Second Space’s first GitHub commits referencing ElevenLabs date back to January 2023 - even before the multilanguage model was released. They recognized ElevenLab’s dedication to quality early on and confidently built out an architecture anticipating future multilingual support. Now, entering markets like Japan and South Korea is as simple as flipping a switch — no extra dev work required! 
## Conclusion
Microservices, real-time events, and ElevenLabs' powerful voice technology make KUBI feel truly alive and ready to conquer and delight the world, one coffee and witty interaction at a time.

# Generative AI Video Editor MNTN VIVA helps marketers generate dynamic adverts with ElevenLabs
Jun 30, 2023 • 3 minutes reading time
ElevenLabs text-to-speech technology is integrated into the new MNTN VIVA platform that offers marketers the ability to streamline audio content.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fzyft0eor4a-mntn-desktop.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fbf4pzmpzbh5-mtn2.png&w=3840&q=95)
MNTN’s ad software brings simplicity and performance to Connected TV advertising. Their Performance TV platform makes running TV ads simple and helps brands drive measurable conversions, revenue, site visits and more.
However, creating and measuring TV campaigns has traditionally been a long process that is expensive and time-consuming. This has prevented a large segment of brands that are focused on targeted markets and audiences from advertising on television. Furthermore, TV campaigns have suffered from a lack of personalisation to appeal to specific audiences. MNTN is solving these challenges with both their technology to be able to deliver solutions for different advertisers. In this sense, 66% of MNTN’s customers are first-time TV advertisers.
In a disruptive move that continues the mission of simplifying TV advertising, MNTN and ElevenLabs partnered to make audio content generation faster, cheaper and personalised. ElevenLabs text-to-speech technology is integrated into the new MNTN VIVA platform that offers marketers the ability to streamline audio content.
ElevenLabs’ cutting-edge technology offers a set of benefits to both MNTN and brands:
  * **Hyper-personalised & Targeted Content:** Engaging audiences and converting them is key to any brand. Conversion rates over the years have suffered due to generic content that doesn’t appeal to audiences. With ElevenLabs, campaigns are able to use the vast wealth of campaign data MNTN provides to generate hyper-personalised audio content at scale.
  * **Generative Tools for Brands:** Brands have traditionally relied on agencies to develop and manage campaigns. They will be the full end-to-end owners of a campaign with the MNTN VIVA platform and instantly hear how content sounds & performs.
  * **Efficient and Effective Process:** Editing a copy and re-recording is time-consuming and requires days or weeks. Marketers will be able to test content in seconds and generate endless variations that adapt to different demographics and geographies.
  * **Cost Reduction:** Medium and small brands struggle with the cost associated with running a TV campaign. ElevenLabs’ voice technology allows all types of brands to benefit from the latest innovations, reach their audiences at scale, and start competing at the same level as larger brands with bigger budgets.
Oliver Embry, Director of Product Innovation at MNTN, gave some additional insights:
“Creative is one of the greatest barriers to enabling brands to be always-on with their Connected TV advertising. ElevenLabs generative voiceover tool allows us to fast track the ad creative process by giving customers the ability to generate studio-quality voiceover in a matter of seconds.”

# Developing multilingual Conversational AI with customizable Text-to-Speech
Mar 4, 2025 • 5 minutes reading time
Customizable text-to-speech makes it possible to make conversational AI multilingual.

[Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai)
A tourist in Tokyo asks their phone for directions — in their native language. An international customer contacts support, expecting assistance in real time. A visually impaired user relies on AI to read aloud important text data.
In all these cases, [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai#ai-agents) needs to do more than just recognize words. It must understand context, support [multiple languages](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/building-customer-trust-through-multilingual-conversational-ai-solutions), and generate voiceovers that sound natural, expressive, and human. That’s where customizable [Text-to-Speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) technology comes in.
In this article, we’ll explore how customizable Text-to-Speech API solutions are shaping the next generation of multilingual AI, making voice AI smarter, more adaptive, and more lifelike than ever.
## **What is multilingual Conversational AI?**
Talking to AI should feel effortless. But too often, it doesn’t. A customer asks a simple question, and the AI stumbles—misunderstanding their intent, struggling with their accent, or failing to switch languages smoothly. Instead of solving problems, the AI creates them.
Multilingual Conversational AI eliminates these barriers. It allows [AI agents](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/best-use-cases-for-conversational-ai-agents) to engage in fluent, [natural-sounding](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-to-generate-natural-sounding-voices-with-text-to-speech-ai) conversations across multiple languages, adapting in real time to user inputs. Instead of relying on rigid, pre-trained models that only recognize fixed phrases, modern Conversational AI applications leverage advanced speech synthesis, machine learning, and Text-to-Speech models to respond verbally in ways that feel human.
The key difference? Understanding. Traditional methods of language processing often fall short because they treat languages as isolated systems. Multilingual Conversational AI, powered by deep learning and real time processing, takes a different approach. It learns from diverse text data, fine tunes speech patterns, and adjusts for regional accents—ensuring that every interaction feels smooth and natural.
From virtual assistants that support global audiences to AI-powered customer service chatbots that convert text into lifelike voices, multilingual AI is changing how people interact with technology. And at the heart of it all? Customizable Text-to-Speech technology that makes AI conversations truly universal.
## How customizable Text-to-Speech powers multilingual AI
Words alone aren’t enough—how AI speaks matters just as much as what it says. A flat, robotic voice makes interactions feel artificial. A voice that struggles with regional accents or speech patterns creates frustration. Without the right Text-to-Speech technology, even the smartest AI can feel unnatural.
Customizable Text-to-Speech changes that. By fine tuning speech synthesis and generating speech that sounds natural, it ensures Conversational AI can adapt to different languages, voices, and user expectations. Here’s how it powers multilingual AI:
  * **Supports multiple languages with ease** – AI agents can instantly switch between different languages, responding verbally in real time without losing clarity or context.
  * **Adapts to regional accents and dialects** – Custom voice models allow businesses to fine tune speech quality, making AI sound natural whether it’s speaking English with a British accent or Spanish with a Latin American tone.
  * **Enhances emotional expression** – Customizable Text-to-Speech enables AI voices to adjust pitch, tone, and pacing, making interactions more engaging and human-like.
  * **Breaks down language barriers for global audiences** – Whether for customer queries, virtual assistants, or interactive voice response systems, multilingual AI ensures that users can communicate effortlessly across different languages.
  * **Improves accessibility for diverse audiences** – Visually impaired users, non-native speakers, and those with speech impairments benefit from AI that generates voiceovers with lifelike voices and real time processing.
  * **Delivers personalized responses** – AI applications can analyze user inputs and fine tune speech synthesis to match the user's tone, intent, and preference for formal or casual speech.

  * Voice AI platform [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) takes a radical leap forward in its efforts to eliminate the linguistic barriers of content with the release of a new foundational deep learning model supporting multilingual capabilities across **28 languages -** **the** **Eleven Multilingual v2**
  * The advancement will allow media companies, game developers, publishers and independent creators across the world to dramatically improve the accessibility of their content
  * These new capabilities, which follow a swath of new feature releases and improvements since the platform launched in January, also mark the official end of the company’s Beta phase
  * ElevenLabs’ mission is to make all content universally accessible in any language and in any voice
[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), the world-leader in voice AI software, has today launched a new multilingual voice generation model**capable of accurately producing ‘emotionally rich’ AI audio in nearly 30 languages.**
[Try Multilingual v2](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis)
The advancement, based entirely on in-house research, will allow creators to produce localized audio content for international markets across Europe, Asia and the Middle East. ElevenLabs has spent the last 18 months analyzing the markers of human speech, building new mechanisms for understanding context and conveying emotions in speech generation, as well as synthesizing new, unique voices.
With Eleven Multilingual v2, when text is inputted to the ElevenLabs [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) platform, **the new model can automatically identify nearly 30 written languages and generate speech in them with an unprecedented level of authenticity.**
At the same time, regardless of whether a synthetic voice or cloned voice is being used, the speaker’s unique voice characteristics are maintained across all languages, including their original accent. This means the same voice can be used to bring content to life across 28 separate languages. 
This [roll-out follows](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/create-a-perfect-digital-copy-of-your-voice-and-speak-the-languages-you-dont/) the public release of **Professional Voice Cloning** to all creators on the platform. This product update, which was made available alongside additional safety and security features, allows users to create a perfect digital copy of their own voice; one that’s virtually indistinguishable from the original.

Following recent feature launches and ongoing improvements to the platform, ElevenLabs has also confirmed today that the platform is officially coming out of Beta. This transition marks a pivotal moment in the company’s dedication to provide reliable and cutting-edge tools for its 1 million+ global users.
Looking ahead, ElevenLabs plans to introduce a mechanism that allows users to share voices on the platform and benefit from the development of new audio, fostering opportunities for human-AI collaboration.
**Mati Staniszewski, CEO and co-founder of ElevenLabs, comments:**
_ElevenLabs was started with the dream of making all content universally accessible in any language and in any voice. With the release of Eleven Multilingual v2, we are one step closer to making this dream a reality and making human-quality AI voices available in every dialect._
_“Our text-to-speech generation tools help level the playing field and bring top quality spoken audio capabilities to all the creators out there. Those benefits now extend to multilingual applications across almost 30 languages. Eventually we hope to cover even more languages and voices with help of AI, and eliminate the linguistic barriers to content. At ElevenLabs, we believe these leaps in accessibility will ultimately foster greater creativity, innovation, and diversity._
By lowering the cost and resources needed to create high-quality audio content in multiple languages, ElevenLabs is enabling companies and creators to produce more imaginative and accessible content which resonates across cultures and languages.
For **independent game developers and publishers** , the multilingual speech generation tool provides new opportunities to translate game experiences and audio content for international audiences, connecting with players and listeners in their own languages without compromising on quality or accuracy of the spoken audio.
Similarly,**educational institutions** now have the means to provide learners with accurate audio content in target languages instantly, bolstering language comprehension and pronunciation skills, as well as catering to different teaching styles and learning needs for international students.
Creators of all types can use ElevenLabs’ tool to improve content **accessibility** for people with visual impairments or additional learning needs by supplementing visual content with speech available in multiple languages.
Its initial suite of AI voice tools unveiled in January 2023 included the ability to turn any text into speech via a selection of pre-designed, synthetic voices and the ability to create a clone of your own voice. The multilingual speech synthesis tool is another step forward on ElevenLabs’ mission to make all content universally accessible in any language and in any voice. 
The technology has already been embraced across multiple creative verticals and sectors, including enabling indie authors to create audio books, voicing secondary characters in video games, supporting the visually impaired to access online written content, and powering the world’s first AI radio channel. ElevenLabs has also partnered with a range of leading content creators and studios, including AI video generators **D-ID** , one of the world largest audiobook publishers **Storytel,** open-access science video platform **ScienceCast** whose video generation tool condenses scientific research papers published on **arXiv,** leading global content creator platform **TheSoul Publishing,** incredible game developers like **Embark Studios** and **Paradox Interactive,** and the media platform**MNTN.**

Transforming your narrative into audio has never been easier. In our latest set of updates to Studio, we’ve redesigned the interface and added new functionalities to help make long-form narration faster and more personalized. 
#### **New functionalities**
Studio now features a refined UI/UX, with a new navbar that functions similarly to ‘Google Docs’, allowing quick, intuitive formatting adjustments.
We've added a Generation History button where you can restore and download previous generations ensuring flexibility with every take.
With our new lock button you can secure any sentence or paragraph once satisfied, preventing accidental changes and helping you track completed sections.
Unmute
With arbitrary regenerations you can select a word or part of a sentence and regenerate only that section, allowing you to fine-tune specific audio outputs, whilst being mindful of character credits.
Unmute
#### **Advanced voice controls**
We listened to your feedback and introduced more voice controls and settings, this means you now have more direction over your audio outputs making narrating long-form content quicker than ever. 
You can:
  * Apply voice changes across multiple paragraphs at once, speeding up the narration process for long-form content.
  * Use multi-voice selection to add different voices within the same paragraph—perfect for character dialogue or varied voiceovers.
  * Customize sentence delivery with settings like speaker boost and increased stability to emphasize certain words and enhance delivery.
When adding voices, your text will be highlighted with matching color symbols on the left, providing a visual guide to easily identify different speakers and spot any errors at-a-glance. 
For an even faster review, we’ve added a keyboard shortcut “Cmd+Opt+A” (Mac) or “Ctrl+Alt+A” (Windows) to see your assigned voices. 
Unmute
#### **Improved playback**
  * For faster audio generation you can now generate multiple paragraphs at once.
  * To speed up or slow down audio listening we’ve added control playback speed (from 0.8x to 2x) to suit your listening preference.
Unmute
#### **Making it easier for you to tell your story, at scale.**
Studio is more than a long-form text-to-audio tool—it’s a creative platform to narrate your story. From scripts to audiobooks, Studio makes it easy to tell your story, at any scale.

## Overview
[Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is becoming more natural as we speak, and advancements in speech synthesis account for a significant portion of these improvements. Optimized speech output allows conversational AI agents to respond in a human-like manner in real-time, changing how we interact with machines and their applications. 
## Conversational AI is beginning to sound real 
Have you ever spoken to a virtual assistant and experienced an uncanny valley effect? Almost as if something felt really…off? Well, that’s no surprise. A robotic, monotone voice can make even the most intelligent AI feel impersonal and frustrating.
Enter optimized speech synthesis; the secret to making AI sound natural, engaging, and, most importantly, lifelike. By fine-tuning how text is converted into speech, we’re creating AI that not only delivers information but does so in a way that feels like talking to a real person.
Let’s explore how speech synthesis is driving the [evolution of conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/the-future-of-voice-assistants-in-conversational-ai) and why optimizing it is the key to creating smarter, more relatable interactions.
## What is speech synthesis?
Speech synthesis, also referred to as [text to speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech), is the technology that converts written text into spoken words. It powers AI’s ability to respond audibly during a conversation.
At the heart of speech synthesis are text-to-speech (TTS) engines. These engines use advanced algorithms to analyze text, determine the appropriate tone, and generate clear, natural-sounding speech. Unlike prerecorded audio, speech synthesis works dynamically, producing real-time responses based on user input.
Speech synthesis is a breath of fresh air for conversational AI. It makes interactions more accessible, engaging, and inclusive, ensuring users feel connected and understood.
## The benefits of speech synthesis optimization
While earlier speech synthesis tools produced a [robotic and monotone output](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/conversational-ai-vs-traditional-chatbots-whats-the-difference), advanced TTS systems can respond with human-like voices in a fraction of the time. 
These advancements demonstrate the importance of continuous speech synthesis optimization, leading to several benefits: 
### Natural pacing
Have you ever noticed how real conversations include pauses, emphasis, and varied tones? Optimized speech synthesis mimics these nuances, making AI responses sound natural rather than robotic.
### Emotional connection
Tone and inflection are the cornerstones of human conversations. Optimized synthesis allows AI to convey emotions like excitement, empathy, or urgency, creating a deeper connection with users.
### Real-time responses
Time is of the essence. A laggy conversational AI agent can be frustrating, especially when you’re running late. Optimized TTS ensures that speech synthesis keeps up with user input, delivering quick replies without compromising interaction quality.
## 5 ways optimized speech synthesis improves AI interactions
Advancements in speech synthesis have undeniably led to significant improvements in conversational AI output. 
While achieving complete authenticity still requires some work to be done, optimized speech synthesis has already contributed to the development of several innovations across multiple industries: 
### 1. Lifelike virtual assistants
Thanks to optimized speech synthesis, voice-enabled assistants like Siri and Alexa are becoming increasingly human-like. They engage in natural conversations, provide instant answers, and even adjust their tone based on context.
### 2. Enhanced gaming experiences
In video games, AI-powered characters with realistic dialogue bring stories to life. Speech synthesis adapts their responses based on player actions, making the gameplay more immersive and interactive.
### 3. Interactive education
AI tutors deliver lessons in a clear, engaging voice, answering follow-up questions in real-time. Whether it’s helping with math problems or teaching a new language, optimized speech synthesis makes e-learning more authentic and dynamic.
### 4. Healthcare support
Speech synthesis enables AI assistants to guide patients through routine tasks like taking medication, tracking symptoms, or scheduling appointments. A soothing, empathetic tone ensures that users feel cared for and supported.
### 5. Customer service bots
TTS technology powers customer service bots to answer inquiries by providing spoken responses, improving the overall experience. Clear, natural speech ensures that users feel heard and understood, even without a human agent.
## Common applications of conversational AI powered by speech synthesis
In addition to the examples listed above, optimized speech synthesis has allowed conversational AI tools to be introduced into our everyday lives. While we don’t always acknowledge its presence, advanced speech synthesis technology is behind many of the realistic interactions we have with AI assistants nowadays. 
**Smart home devices:** Virtual assistants like Google Assistant use speech synthesis to provide real-time updates, control IoT devices, and [respond to user commands in a natural voice](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/the-role-of-voice-technology-in-conversational-ai).
**Language learning apps:** Apps like Duolingo use TTS to model accurate pronunciation and guide users through conversational practice, helping them build confidence in new languages.
**Entertainment platforms:** Audiobooks and interactive storytelling apps leverage optimized TTS to narrate stories in engaging, lifelike voices that adapt to the tone and context of the narrative.
**Retail kiosks:** In stores, AI-powered kiosks use speech synthesis to guide shoppers, answer product questions, and make personalized recommendations, enhancing the shopping experience.
**Transportation hubs:** Digital assistants at airports and train stations provide real-time announcements and wayfinding assistance in clear, easy-to-understand voices.

![ElevenLabs Logo for Blog](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fx1b6d7s30d-ElevenLabsBlogLogo.webp&w=3840&q=95)
Whether you want to optimize an existing conversational AI agent or build one from scratch, integrating natural speech capabilities is easier than ever with ElevenLabs. Choose from a vast array of realistic AI voices to bring your agent to life or even create your own. 
Here’s how to get started: 
### 1. Choose or create a voice
You can begin by selecting a narrator from ElevenLabs’ library of lifelike voices or [designing a custom voice](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-design) to suit the context of your brand or project. 
### 2. Fine-tune delivery
Adjust tone, pacing, and inflection to match the context of your application. Whether you’re building a healthcare assistant, virtual tutor, or video game character, the customization options are endless.
### 3. Integrate into your AI system
Once you’ve selected and customized your desired voice, integrate the [ElevenLabs TTS API](https://elevenlabs.io/api) into your conversational AI platform for real-time, dynamic speech synthesis.
### 4. Test and refine
Run scenarios to evaluate how your AI sounds in real-world interactions. Use feedback to tweak voice settings and ensure optimal response quality.
### 5. Launch and monitor
Deploy your TTS-powered AI and keep an eye on its performance. Continuous monitoring helps maintain quality and meet user expectations.
## Challenges in optimizing speech synthesis
While speech synthesis optimization has led to many valuable innovations, progress is still to be made. Pressing challenges experienced by developers include:
**Balancing speed and quality:** Achieving quick, real-time responses without sacrificing output quality is an ongoing challenge. While advanced TTS tools like ElevenLabs address this with powerful processing capabilities, there’s still room for improvement. 
**Ensuring emotional authenticity:** Making AI voices sound empathetic or enthusiastic can be tricky. Ongoing improvements in TTS are helping AI convey more genuine emotions, but fully replicating human speech output is still a work in progress. 
**Developing multilingual capabilities:** Adapting optimized speech synthesis for multiple languages requires understanding cultural nuances and pronunciation. Advanced tools like ElevenLabs offer multilingual support to meet these needs, but we still have a long way to go before we can cover all languages. 
## Final thoughts
Optimized speech synthesis undoubtedly enhances conversational AI output, making it more human-like, engaging, and accessible. From smart home devices to gaming, education, and healthcare, this technology changes how we interact with AI in real-time.
While there’s still some progress to be made regarding quality, authenticity, and multilingual capabilities, advanced TTS tools like ElevenLabs offer developers an effective shortcut to optimizing their conversational AI agents.

The days of manually dialing numbers and hoping for the best are over. In 2025, AI-powered outbound sales is taking center stage, powered by [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai#ai-agents) agents.
With [AI call centers](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/thoughtly), businesses can automate outbound calls, prioritize high-quality leads, and use sales automation to eliminate repetitive tasks. The result? Sales representatives spend less time chasing uninterested prospects and more time having meaningful conversations that lead to real revenue.
This guide will show you how to use AI to power your business's outbound calls. It's time to work smarter, not harder.
## **How AI is changing outbound sales**
[Conversational AI is transforming a huge range of business processes](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/best-use-cases-for-conversational-ai-agents), including outbound sales. Businesses can now create AI-powered sales agents that handle outbound calls at scale—engaging leads, answering questions, and moving prospects through the sales funnel without human intervention. No more wasted time. No more dead-end calls. Just smarter, automated outreach that drives results.
These AI agents do more than follow a script. They understand natural language, process customer interactions, and adapt based on past interactions and customer preferences. They pull from customer data, personalize outreach, and deliver consistent messaging—ensuring every conversation feels tailored, not robotic. More calls. Better engagement. Higher-quality leads.
But it’s not just about making calls. AI-powered sales tools provide real-time analytics and key metrics to refine outbound sales strategies. Businesses can track call volume, lead qualification rates, and conversion success, making every decision data-driven. No more guesswork—just actionable insights that improve sales performance.
The impact? More productivity. More closed deals. Faster business growth. With AI-driven outbound calling, businesses [streamline workflows](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/how-businesses-are-streamlining-workflows-with-conversational-ai), reduce repetitive tasks, and let human reps focus on what they do best—closing deals.
## Balancing AI outbound calling with human sales agents
AI can handle outbound calls at scale. It qualifies leads, gathers customer data, and moves prospects through the sales funnel. But when it comes to closing deals and handling complex interactions, the human touch is still essential. The best outbound sales strategies combine AI-powered automation with skilled sales representatives—allowing each to do what they do best.
AI sales agents take care of the heavy lifting. They automate routine calls, handle lead qualification, and ensure consistent messaging across every interaction. They can answer common objections, schedule follow-ups, and provide real-time analytics to help refine sales efforts. This means sales teams waste less time chasing dead-end leads and focus only on high-quality prospects.
Once a lead is warm and ready to convert, human agents step in. Unlike AI, they bring emotional intelligence, adaptability, and strategic thinking to the conversation. They can negotiate, build trust, and address concerns that require a personal touch. With AI handling the early stages, sales reps spend more time on meaningful conversations—where their expertise makes all the difference.
This AI-human collaboration creates optimal sales success. AI-powered tools ensure efficiency, while human agents close the deal. The result? Higher sales productivity, better customer engagement, and more conversions. In 2025, the smartest sales teams won’t choose between AI and people—they’ll use both to dominate the market.

# Paradox Interactive speeds up audio generation from weeks to hours with ElevenLabs
Jun 30, 2023 • 3 minutes reading time
Together we are speeding up the AAA game development process.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fwwlknm99509-paradox-interactive-desktop.jpg&w=3840&q=95)![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F35bzpaf4gfk-paradox.png&w=3840&q=95)
Paradox Interactive is the leading Swedish game developer and publisher behind some of the most iconic games in the market today; from Stellaris to Cities: Skylines to Crusader Kings III.
Game development for AAA studios is a complex process that involves hundreds of stakeholders and multi-year-long development cycles. There are usually multiple iterations of narratives and gameplay dynamics during pre-production that can be very costly and time-consuming. In a groundbreaking move, Paradox Interactive has partnered with ElevenLabs to integrate its cutting-edge voice technology into the development process to streamline voice generation.
Furthermore, Paradox Interactive aims to continue its tradition of allowing the community to create their own narrative and develop new content. One of the most exciting aspects of the partnership between Paradox Interactive and ElevenLabs is the potential for players to change and improve the game's content after its release.
Incorporating ElevenLabs’ generative AI technology offers several benefits:
  * **Efficient Iteration:** During the pre-production phase, game developers often need to revise and iterate on dialogue and story elements. With [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) technology, these revisions can be made quickly and easily. [TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/text-to-speech) no longer requires the Audio or Narrative teams to record the narrative themselves.
  * **Cost Savings:** Large and complex AAA games have extensive dialogues and narratives that may change up to the moment of release. Using employees to record narratives or make last-minute changes can be time-consuming and expensive. By using text-to-speech technology, Paradox will be able to save costs and resources to make its development process more efficient.
  * **Flexible Localization:** As a global publisher, Paradox Interactive releases games in multiple languages. ElevenLabs' voice technology supports a wide range of languages and accents, allowing Paradox to efficiently localize its games for different markets.
  * **Accessibility:** A By using high-quality text-to-speech, Paradox can improve the accessibility of their games for players who are visually impaired or have difficulty reading on-screen text.
  * **New Narratives and Expansions:** Games are constantly evolving; from expansions to new branching narratives or open-world experiences. TTS technology will allow Paradox to explore a new set of creative experiences.
Ernesto Lopez, Audio Director for Stellaris and CK3, said this about the partnership:
“We’re incredibly pleased with the results from the ElevenLabs platform. We were looking for a solution that could enable us to prototype voiceover content for our games, and the samples created by their contextually aware engine have exceeded our expectations. We have also been inspired to push the limits of our projects. As each iteration proves more capable and the results reach higher quality, this system helps us imagine more intricate and richer VO design for our games. At Paradox, our players and the stories they create in our games matter to us greatly. The use of such an accomplished tool means we have the opportunity to push the player experience to a whole new level. We are very excited to embark on this adventure with ElevenLabs and looking forward to the path ahead.”

## **Why personalization is key to successful marketing**
Personalized marketing campaigns are essential for effective marketing - **80% of consumers** are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences.
One way personalized campaigns can deliver relevant content to their potential customers is by adopting AI tools. AI technologies, such as natural language processing, enable deeper insights into customer needs and preferences.
By analyzing historical customer interaction and website data, AI's ability to provide precise data analysis and interpret customer feedback leads to increased customer satisfaction. This AI revolution is reshaping the marketing landscape, setting future trends for more targeted and effective marketing strategies.
## **Understanding customer behavior**
AI-driven tools can track key performance indicators and predict customer behavior. For example, Netflix uses predictive analytics to recommend shows based on viewing history, contributing to their high customer retention rate. This data-driven approach helps marketers anticipate customer needs, improving the personalized shopping experience and overall customer journey.
## **Using AI tools for smarter marketing**
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fqdfpn9qb46-Speech%20Synthesis%20UI%20Redesign.jpg&w=3840&q=95)
AI tools are transforming marketing campaigns by providing data-driven insights and making customers more likely to engage with new content. For instance, AI voice tools like[ ElevenLabs' AI Dubbing](https://elevenlabs.io/dubbing) and [Multilingual TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/languages) enable personalized interactions across different languages and regions - marketers can translate content across 29 languages in seconds.
AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, such as those provided by Drift and Intercom, offer instant support and analyze customer queries to improve customer satisfaction. AI audio is essential for these use-cases. But to best increase customer satisfaction, AI voices need to remain as authentic-sounding as possible.
With ElevenLabs' [Multilingual TTS](https://elevenlabs.io/languages) and [AI Dubbing](https://elevenlabs.io/dubbing), translated audio retains the characteristics of the original speaker, meaning speech remains lifelike and engaging. Marketers can fine-tune their audio to support linguistic nuances or regional dialects, as well as having full control over intonation and natural pauses. With end-to-end design, integrating AI voices into video content is simple, and with AI assistants, customers likely won't even realize they're speaking to a bot.

**Marketing strategy**
A successful marketing strategy involves leveraging AI tools to gain deeper insights into customer behavior.

  * [Making requests](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/authentication#making-requests)
## API Keys
The ElevenLabs API uses API keys for authentication. Every request to the API must include your API key, used to authenticate your requests and track usage quota.
Each API key can be scoped to one of the following:
  1. **Scope restriction:** Set access restrictions by limiting which API endpoints the key can access.
  2. **Credit quota:** Define custom credit limits to control usage.
**Remember that your API key is a secret.** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps).
All API requests should include your API key in an `xi-api-key` HTTP header as follows:
```

$
| xi-api-key: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

---|---  

```
### Making requests
You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace `$ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` with your secret API key.
```

$
| curl 'https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/models' \

---|---  

>
|   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

>
|   -H 'xi-api-key: $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY'

```
Example with the `elevenlabs` Python package:
```

1
| from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs

---|---  

2  

3
| client = ElevenLabs(

4
|   api_key='YOUR_API_KEY',

5
| )

```
Example with the `elevenlabs` Node.js package:
```

1
| import { ElevenLabsClient } from 'elevenlabs';

---|---  

2  

3
| const client = new ElevenLabsClient({

4
|   apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',

5
| });

```

## What is Conversational AI?
ElevenLabs [Conversational AI](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai) is a platform for deploying customized, conversational voice agents. Built in response to our customers’ needs, our platform eliminates months of development time typically spent building conversation stacks from scratch. It combines these building blocks:
Speech to text
Our fine tuned ASR model that transcribes the caller’s dialogue.
Language model
Choose from Gemini, Claude, OpenAI and more, or bring your own.
Text to speech
Our low latency, human-like TTS across 5k+ voices and 31 languages.
Turn taking
Our custom turn taking and interruption detection service that feels human.
Altogether it is a highly composable AI Voice agent solution that can scale to thousands of calls per day. With [server](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/server-tools) & [client side](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/customization/tools/client-tools) tools, [knowledge](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/customization/knowledge-base) bases, [dynamic](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/dynamic-variables) agent instantiation and [overrides](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/customization/personalization/overrides), plus built-in monitoring, it’s the complete developer toolkit.
Pricing
15 minutes to get started on the free plan. Get 13,750 minutes included on the Business plan at $0.08 per minute on the Business plan, with extra minutes billed at $0.08, as well as significantly discounted pricing at higher volumes.
**Setup & Prompt Testing**: billed at half the cost.
Usage is billed to the account that created the agent. If authentication is not enabled, anybody with your agent’s id can connect to it and consume your credits. To protect against this, either enable authentication for your agent or handle the agent id as a secret.

## Partner with ElevenLabs Impact program
At ElevenLabs, we drive social good through AI audio. Our Impact Program partners with nonprofits to provide free licenses for projects in accessibility, education, and culture. We aim to enable 1 million voices to communicate and learn without barriers. If your nonprofit could benefit from AI audio, we’d love to hear from you. Let’s create a world where every voice makes a difference.
[Partner with us](https://elevenlabs.io/impact-partners)
## Free licenses for accessibility individuals
In August 2024, ElevenLabs launched an initiative to support those struggling with aphasia by providing free licenses to ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and MND (Motor Neuron Disease) patients. We are proud to now extend this offering to individuals with MSA (Multiple System Atrophy) and mouth cancer. We are excited to continue expanding eligibility as we work toward our goal of reaching one million people.

## Breaking barriers in accessibility
When U.S. Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton began losing her voice due to Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), it seemed like the end of her ability to communicate in her own words. The standard robotic voice wasn’t just limiting—it felt like a loss of identity. But with ElevenLabs' technology, everything changed. By recreating her voice as it sounded before her diagnosis, Congresswoman Wexton became the first lawmaker to deliver a House floor speech powered by AI, proving that even at the top of their field, people can overcome incredible challenges with the right tools.

Updated 28 February 2025
This Privacy Policy ("**Policy** ") explains how Eleven Labs Inc. and our affiliates (Eleven Labs Ltd. and Eleven Labs Poland sp. z o.o.) (“**ElevenLabs** ”, "**we** ", "**our** ", or "**us** ") process Personal Data (defined below) of individuals who use our services, including our platform, websites (e.g., elevenlabs.io), mobile applications, and other online services (jointly, the "**Services** ").

In this Policy, "**Personal Data** " means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or email address. In certain jurisdictions, this may also be referred to as “Personal Information.” 
This Policy applies to instances in which we offer our Services, products, and platforms to individual users. For these relationships, ElevenLabs acts as a data controller and is governed by this Policy.
This Policy does not apply when we offer our Services and process Personal Data on behalf of enterprise/business customers. We act as a service provider/data processor for those relationships and our use of that data is governed by our customer agreements.
## **1. Categories of Personal Data We Collect:**

**(b) Personal Data and ElevenLabs Voice Modeling Services**
ElevenLabs uses Voice Data to provide its voice services, including voice modeling, speech-to-speech, and dubbing services. For voice modeling, when you provide us with recordings of your voice, we utilize our proprietary, AI-based technologies that analyze your speech characteristics to formulate a distinct voice model of your vocal traits. This voice model can be used to generate audio resembling your voice. Depending on where you reside and how we use your Voice Data (as set out in this Policy), applicable law may define your Voice Data as biometric data. We do not use Voice Data to infer characteristics about an individual.
**(c) Personal Data and ElevenLabs Training Models**
ElevenLabs uses Voice Data to help our models and products learn about patterns and connections in speech and audio content and to improve our Services. We do not use Voice Data, Personal Data, or publicly available data used for training to profile or target consumers. 
**(d) Content Moderation and User Suspension**
ElevenLabs does not undertake to review all Content and expressly disclaims any duty or obligation to monitor or review content. However, to maintain the integrity and security of your data, and for fraud prevention purposes, ElevenLabs reserves the right to moderate all voice and text data input into ElevenLabs tools and voice or other outputs. In certain circumstances, ElevenLabs may share your inputs or outputs, which may include Personal Data, with third parties to support the content moderation and safety initiatives. Users found to have engaged in activity that violates the Prohibited Use Policy may be subject to termination or suspension under the applicable Terms of Service.

## ElevenLabs safety in practice
We are guided by three principles to manage risk while ensuring AI audio benefits people worldwide: **moderation** , **accountability** , and **provenance**.
### Moderation
We actively monitor content generated with our technology.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fto2zw8bjt2a-moderation.png&w=3840&q=95)
**Automated moderation.** Our automated systems scan content for violations of our [policies](https://elevenlabs.io/use-policy), blocking them outright or flagging them for review.
**Human moderation.** A growing team of moderators reviews flagged content and helps us ensure that our policies are adopted consistently.
**No-go voices.** While our policies prohibit impersonations, we use an additional safety tool to detect and prevent the creation of content with voices deemed especially high-risk.
**voiceCAPTCHA.** We developed a proprietary voice verification technology to minimize unauthorized use of voice cloning tools, which ensures that users of our high-fidelity voice cloning tool can only clone their own voice.
### [Prohibited content and uses policy](https://elevenlabs.io/use-policy)
Learn about the types of content and activities that are not allowed when using our tools.
### Accountability
We believe misuse must have consequences.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2Fderysu2gdd8-accountability.png&w=3840&q=95)
**Traceability.** When a bad actor misuses our tools, we want to know who they are. Our systems let us trace generated content back to the originating accounts and our voice cloning tools are only available to users who verified their accounts with billing details.
**Bans.** We want bad actors to know that they have no place on our platform. We permanently ban users who violate our [policies](https://elevenlabs.io/use-policy).
**Partnering with law enforcement.** We will cooperate with the authorities, and in appropriate cases, report or disclose information about illegal content or activity.
### [Report Content](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=13145996177937)
If you find content which raises concerns, and you believe it was created with our tools, please report it here.
### Provenance
We believe that you should know if audio is AI-generated.
![](https://elevenlabs.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feleven-public-cdn.elevenlabs.io%2Fpayloadcms%2F6dvem2vx22o-provenance.png&w=3840&q=95)
**AI Speech Classifier.** We developed a highly accurate detection tool which maintains 99% precision and 80% recall if the sample wasn't modified and lets anyone check if an audio file could have been generated with our technology.
**AI Detection Standards.** We believe that downstream AI detection tools, such as metadata, watermarks, and fingerprinting solutions, are essential. We support the widespread adoption of industry standards for provenance through .
**Collaboration.** We invite fellow AI companies, academia, and policymakers to work together on developing industry-wide methods for AI content detection. We are part of the Content Authenticity Initiative, and partner with content distributors and civil society to establish AI content transparency. We also support governmental efforts on AI safety, and are a member of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) AI Safety Institute Consortium.

## **10. Disclaimers**
Your use of our Services, Beta Services and any content or materials provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) is at your sole risk. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, our Services, Beta Services and any content or materials provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. ElevenLabs disclaims all warranties with respect to the foregoing, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

Responses requested by and generated for other users that are not you shall not be considered Output for you, and you shall have no right or title over it.
## **11. Limitation of Liability**
**(a)** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, ElevenLabs will not be liable to you under any theory of liability (whether based in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, or otherwise) for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages or lost profits, even if ElevenLabs has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
**(b)** The total liability of ElevenLabs for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of: (i) One Hundred United States Dollars ($100 USD); and (ii) the amount paid by you to use our Services in the 12 months preceding the claim.
## **12. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration**
Please read this Section 12 carefully because it requires you and ElevenLabs to arbitrate certain disputes and claims and limits the manner in which we can seek relief from each other. Arbitration precludes you and ElevenLabs from suing in court or having a jury trial. You and ElevenLabs agree that arbitration will be solely on an individual basis and not as a class arbitration, class action, or any other kind of representative proceeding. ElevenLabs and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury.Follow the instructions below if you wish to opt out of the requirement of arbitration on an individual basis. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement.
**(a) Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration.** For any dispute or claim between you and ElevenLabs arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services or these Terms and prior versions of these Terms, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of these Terms, or any privacy or data security claims, (collectively, “**Disputes** ”, and each a “**Dispute** ”), you and ElevenLabs agree to attempt to first resolve the Claim informally via the following process:
  * If you assert a Dispute against ElevenLabs, you will first contact ElevenLabs by sending a written notice of your Dispute to ElevenLabs by email to 
  * If you and ElevenLabs cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within 30 days after you or ElevenLabs receives the applicable notice, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration as set forth below. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for thirty (30) days from the date that either you or ElevenLabs first send the applicable notice so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.
**(b) Disputes Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions.** Except for individual disputes that qualify for small claims court and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual property rights of you or ElevenLabs, including any disputes in which you or ElevenLabs seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of your or ElevenLabs’ intellectual property or other infringement of your or ElevenLabs’ intellectual property rights (“**IP Disputes** ”), all Disputes, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 12(a) will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury. The arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“**JAMS** ”) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court. The remedies and reliefs rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “**Request** ”). The Request must include: (i) the name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number of the party seeking arbitration and the email address associated with any applicable account; (ii) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (iii) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (iv) a statement certifying completion of the informal dispute resolution process as described in Section 12(a) above; and (v) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.
If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include such counsel’s name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (A) the Request is not being presented for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (B) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (C) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. 
You and ElevenLabs agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or authorized representatives, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings strictly confidential. 
**(c) Opting Out of Arbitration.** You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted these Terms by providing us with notice of your decision to opt-out via email or by certified mail to the applicable address set out below. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 12.

**(e) Severability.** If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 12 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 12; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 12 will be enforceable.
**(f) Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND ELEVENLABS HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and ElevenLabs are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under these Terms, except as specified in Section 12(b). 
**(g) Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief.** YOU AND ELEVENLABS AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12(h), EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Section 12, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 12(h). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, you and ElevenLabs agree that the particular claim or request for relief, and only that particular claim or request for relief, shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of New York. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This Section does not prevent you or ElevenLabs from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.
**(h) Batch Arbitration.** To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and ElevenLabs agree that in the event that there are 100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against ElevenLabs by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall: (i) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (ii) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (iii) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“**Batch Arbitration** ”).
All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“**Administrative Arbitrator** ”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by ElevenLabs. 
You and ElevenLabs agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. **This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.**
## **13. Governing Law**
Any Claims will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except to the extent preempted by U.S. Federal Law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. If any Claim is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 12, then the state and federal courts located in New York City, New York, will have exclusive jurisdiction. You and ElevenLabs waive any objection to venue in any such courts. If your local law requires that consumer contracts be interpreted subject to local law and enforced in the courts of that jurisdiction, this section may not apply to you only to the extent that local law conflicts with this section.
## **14. Modifying and Terminating Our Services**
We may: (a) modify, impose limits on, replace, upgrade, update, suspend, or terminate providing all or part of our Services at any time; (b) charge, modify, or waive any fees required to use the Services; or (c) offer opportunities to some or all end users of the Services, each of (a) through (c) without any liability or additional notice to you. All modifications and additions to the Services will be governed by the Terms or Supplemental Terms, unless otherwise expressly stated by ElevenLabs in writing. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.
## **15. Export Control**
You are responsible for compliance with United States export controls and for any violation of such controls, including any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting exports. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country or territory that is subject to economic sanctions or trade embargoes imposed by the U.S. Government (including Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and the annexed regions of Ukraine), that you are not listed on identified on any U.S. Government list of sanctioned individuals, that you will comply fully with all relevant export laws and regulations of the United States and other international trade laws applicable to your use of the Services.
## **16. Miscellaneous**
**(a)** ElevenLabs’ failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements, and understandings of the parties. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. Communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.
**(b)** The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Lists of examples following “including” or “e.g.” or similar words are not exhaustive (that is, they are interpreted to include “without limitation”). All monetary amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. URLs are understood to also refer to successor URLs, URLs for localized content, and information or resources linked from within the websites at the specified URLs. The word “or” will be deemed an inclusive “or”.
**(c)** If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of these Terms; and (c) the unenforceable or unlawful provision may be revised to the extent required to render the Terms enforceable or valid, and the rights and responsibilities of the parties will be interpreted and enforced accordingly, so as to preserve the Terms and the intent of the Terms to the fullest possible extent.
**(d)** If you have a question or complaint regarding the Services, please send an email to 
  * Eleven Labs Inc.

You acknowledge that you have had the opportunity to review the Usage Rules.
(ii)**Scope of License.** The license granted to you is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Mobile App on any iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, or any other Apple device that you own or control as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.
(iii)**Maintenance and Support.** You and ElevenLabs acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Mobile App.
(iv) **Warranty.** You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, with respect to the Mobile App. In the event of any failure of the Mobile App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, paid to Apple for the Mobile App by you; and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Mobile App. The parties acknowledge that to the extent that there are any applicable warranties, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any such applicable warranty would be the sole responsibility of ElevenLabs. However, ElevenLabs has disclaimed all warranties of any kind with respect to the Mobile App, and therefore, there are no warranties applicable to the Mobile App.
(v)**Product Claims.** You and ElevenLabs acknowledge that as between Apple and ElevenLabs, ElevenLabs, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the Mobile App or your possession and/or use of the Mobile App, including, but not limited to (A) product liability claims, (B) any claim that the Mobile App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and (C) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

(vii)**Third-Party Beneficiary.** Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
**(b) Google Play Store.** The following terms apply if you download our Mobile App from Google Play (or its successors) operated by Google, Inc. or one of its affiliates (“**Google** ”).
(i) **Google Play Terms.** You acknowledge that to the extent of any conflict between (A) the Google Play Terms of Services and the Google Play Business and Program Policies or such other terms which Google designates as default end user license terms for Google Play (all of which together are referred to as the “**Google Play Terms** ”), and (B) the other terms and conditions in these Terms, the Google Play Terms shall apply with respect to your use of the Mobile App that you download from Google Play.
(ii) **Acknowledgement.** You acknowledge that Google does not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or noncompliance by ElevenLabs or you (or any other user) under these Terms or the Google Play Terms.
