Fish Speech 1.2 / 1.3 Achitecture
We are thrilled to announce the release of Fish Speech 1.3 on our website, [fish.audio](https://fish.audio), powered by 
On fish.audio, you can now create your own voice with just ~15 seconds of audio and synthesize speech seamlessly.
To train Fish Speech 1.3, we collected 500k hours of audio data from English, Chinese, and Japanese, a substantial increase from the 300k hours used for version 1.2. Following standard pretraining and SFT, we integrated RLHF-DPO into our models, significantly reducing hallucinations and missing words.
Our Fish Audio website runs on Lepton AI, a stable, powerful, and user-friendly AI serving platform. Thanks to Lepton AI, we have been able to streamline our inference stages and handle a much higher throughput efficiently.

Hello, I would like to ask. Sometimes when six to eight reference audios are provided, after the model generates an audio, there will be long silent segments in the…more

Create Model
[Documentation](https://docs.fish.audio/introduction)[API Reference](https://docs.fish.audio/api-reference/introduction)
[Fish Audio home page![light logo](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hanabiaiinc/logo/light.svg)![dark logo](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hanabiaiinc/logo/dark.svg)](https://fish.audio)
You can create a model using the Python SDK, MessagePack API, or FormData API.
## 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/create-model#python-sdk)
Python SDK
To begin with, you need to make sure you have the Python SDK installed: 
Copy
```
from fish_audio_sdk import Session

session = Session("your_api_key")

model = session.create_model(
    title="test",
    description="test",
    voices=[voice_file.read(), other_voice_file.read()],
    cover_image=image_file.read(),
)
print(model)

```
## 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/create-model#messagepack-api)

Text to Speech
[Documentation](https://docs.fish.audio/introduction)[API Reference](https://docs.fish.audio/api-reference/introduction)
[Fish Audio home page![light logo](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hanabiaiinc/logo/light.svg)![dark logo](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hanabiaiinc/logo/dark.svg)](https://fish.audio)
For better speech quality and lower latency, upload reference audio via the [create model](https://docs.fish.audio/api-reference/endpoint/model/create-model) endpoint. This method uses the Fish Audio SDK and provides a more streamlined approach.
## 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/text-to-speech#using-the-fish-audio-sdk)
Using the Fish Audio SDK
First, make sure you have the Fish Audio SDK installed. You can install it from 
### 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/text-to-speech#example-usage)
Example Usage
reference_id.py
reference_audio
model_specify.py
Copy
```
from fish_audio_sdk import Session, TTSRequest, ReferenceAudio

session = Session("your_api_key")

# Option 1: Using a reference_id
with open("output1.mp3", "wb") as f:
    for chunk in session.tts(TTSRequest(
        reference_id="MODEL_ID_UPLOADED_OR_CHOSEN_FROM_PLAYGROUND",
        text="Hello, world!"
    )):
        f.write(chunk)

```
This example demonstrates three ways to use the Text-to-Speech API:
  1. Using a `reference_id`: This option uses a model that you’ve previously uploaded or chosen from the playground. Replace `"MODEL_ID_UPLOADED_OR_CHOSEN_FROM_PLAYGROUND"` with the actual model ID.
  2. Using reference audio: This option allows you to provide a reference audio file and its corresponding text directly in the request.
  3. Using a specific TTS model: You can specify which model to use with the `backend` parameter when calling the `tts` method. Available options include:
     * `"speech-1.5"`
     * `"speech-1.6"`
Make sure to replace `"your_api_key"` with your actual API key, and adjust the file paths as needed.
## 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/text-to-speech#raw-api-usage)
Raw API Usage
If you prefer to use the raw API instead of the SDK, you can still use the MessagePack API as described below.
### 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/text-to-speech#endpoint-details)
Endpoint Details
  * Method: POST
  * URL: <https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts>
  * Content-Type: application/msgpack
### 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/text-to-speech#headers)
Headers
  * `authorization`: Bearer token authentication with your API key
  * `content-type`: application/msgpack
  * `model` (optional): Specify which TTS model to use. Available options include: 
    * `speech-1.5`
    * `speech-1.6`

Example Usage
sync.py
async.py
Copy
```
from fish_audio_sdk import WebSocketSession, TTSRequest, ReferenceAudio

sync_websocket = WebSocketSession("your_api_key")

def stream():
    text = "Well, you know, machine learning is like, um, this really fascinating field that's basically teaching computers to, eh, figure things out on their own."
    for line in text.split():
        yield line + " "

tts_request = TTSRequest(
    text="",  # Initial text or empty string
    reference_id="MODEL_ID_UPLOADED_OR_CHOSEN_FROM_PLAYGROUND",
    temperature=0.7,  # Controls randomness in speech generation
    top_p=0.7,  # Controls diversity via nucleus sampling
)

# Or you can use reference audio
# tts_request = TTSRequest(
#     text="",
#     references=[
#         ReferenceAudio(
#             audio=open("lengyue.wav", "rb").read(),
#             text="Text in reference AUDIO",
#         )
#     ],
#     temperature=0.7,
#     top_p=0.7,
# )

with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    for chunk in sync_websocket.tts(
        tts_request,
        stream(), # Stream the text
        backend="speech-1.6"  # Specify which TTS model to use
    ):
        f.write(chunk)

```
This example demonstrates how to use the Text-to-Speech WebSocket API:
     * `"speech-1.5"` (default)
     * `"speech-1.6"`
  4. Controlling speech generation:
     * `temperature` (default: 0.7): Controls randomness in the speech generation. Higher values (e.g., 1.0) make the output more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.1) make it more deterministic.
     * `top_p` (default: 0.7): Controls diversity via nucleus sampling. Lower values (e.g., 0.1) make the output more focused, while higher values (e.g., 1.0) allow more diversity.

Raw WebSocket API Usage
The WebSocket API provides real-time, bidirectional communication for Text-to-Speech streaming. Here’s how the protocol works:
### 
[​](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/text-to-speech-ws#websocket-protocol)
WebSocket Protocol
  1. **Connection Endpoint** :
     * URL: `wss://api.fish.audio/v1/tts/live`
  2. **Connection Headers** :
     * `Authorization`: Bearer token authentication with your API key
     * `model` (optional): Specify which TTS model to use. Available options include: 
       * `speech-1.5` (default)
       * `speech-1.6`
  3. **Events** :
a. `start` - Initializes the TTS session:
Copy
```
{
  "event": "start",
  "request": {
    "text": "",  // Initial empty text
    "latency": "normal",  // "normal" or "balanced"
    "format": "opus",  // "opus", "mp3", or "wav"
    "temperature": 0.7,  // Controls randomness in speech generation
    "top_p": 0.7,  // Controls diversity via nucleus sampling
    // Optional: Use prosody to control speech speed and volume
    "prosody": {
      "speed": 1.0,  // Speech speed (0.5-2.0)
      "volume": 0    // Volume adjustment in dB
    },
    "reference_id": "MODEL_ID_UPLOADED_OR_CHOSEN_FROM_PLAYGROUND"
    // Optional: Use reference audio instead of reference_id
    "references": [{
      "audio": "<binary_audio_data>",
      "text": "Reference text for the audio"
    }],
  }
}

```
b. `text` - Sends text chunks:
Copy
```
{
  "event": "text",
  "text": "Hello world " // Don't forget the space since all text is concatenated
}

```
There is a text buffer on the server side. Only when this buffer reaches a certain size will an audio event be generated.
Sending a stop event will force the buffer to be flushed, return an audio event, and end the session.
c. `audio` - Receives audio data (server response):
Copy
```
{
  "event": "audio",
  "audio": "<binary_audio_data>",
  "time": 3.012 // Time taken in milliseconds
}

```
d. `stop` - Ends the session:
Copy
```
{
  "event": "stop"
}

```
e. `flush` - Flushes the text buffer: This immediately generates the audio and returns it, if text is too short, it may lead to under-quality audio.
Copy
```
{
  "event": "flush"
}

```
f. `finish` - Ends the session (server side):
Copy
```
{
  "event": "finish",
  "reason": "stop" // or "error"
}

```
g. `log` - Logs messages from the server if debug is true:
Copy
```
{
  "event": "log",
  "message": "Log message from server"
}

```
  4. **Message Format** : All messages use MessagePack encoding

This example demonstrates:
  1. Real-time text streaming with WebSocket connection
  2. Handling audio chunks as they arrive
  3. Using MPV player for real-time audio playback
  4. Reference audio support for voice cloning
  5. Proper connection handling and cleanup
Make sure to install required dependencies:
Copy
```
pip install websockets ormsgpack openai

```
And install MPV player for audio playback (optional):
  * Linux: `apt-get install mpv`
  * macOS: `brew install mpv`
  * Windows: Download from

One finds, rather unexpectedly, that the most profound moments in life arrive like whispers rather than declarations. The sheer audacity of art, in all its forms, lies in its ability to transform the mundane into something utterly transcendent. I've always maintained that true creativity emerges from that delicate space between discipline and abandon, much like a tightrope walker finding their perfect balance. In this remarkable tapestry we call existence, we're all simultaneously the artist and the observer, crafting our narratives while witnessing those of others unfold. And perhaps that's the most extraordinary thing about being human - this constant dance between creating and becoming, between speaking and listening, between knowing and wondering.

Okay, you guys literally need to see this new foundation brush I found. It's so incredibly soft and blends everything like butter. The best part? It's normally $45 but right now it's on sale for $28 with a free setting spray. Like, such an amazing deal!

When the Services require or include downloadable software, that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical.
Change of Terms 
We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so this Agreement may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change this Agreement at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at https://fish.audio/terms/, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.
If you don’t agree with the new terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to this Agreement is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Fish.Audio a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example, making sure your content is viewable on a mobile device as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
If you store a User Submission in your own personal Fish.Audio Account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Fish.Audio the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.
If you share a User Submission in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant Fish.Audio the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a “Public User Submission”), then you grant Fish.Audio the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Fish.Audio’s users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with Fish.Audio’s business, including the right to use, display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for Fish.Audio’s marketing and promotional purposes. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your Fish.Audio Account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions (other than Public User Submissions, which may remain fully available) to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Fish.Audio’s records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.
Certain features of the Services allow you to share information with others, including through your social networks or other Third Party Accounts. When Content is authorized for sharing, we will clearly identify the Content you are authorized to redistribute and the ways you may redistribute it, usually by providing a “share” button on or near the Content. If you share information from the Services with others through your Third Party Accounts, such as your social networks, you authorize Fish.Audio to share that information with the applicable Third Party Account provider. Please review the policies of any Third Party Account providers you share information with or through for additional information about how they may use your information. If you redistribute Content, you must be able to edit or delete any Content you redistribute, and you must edit or delete it promptly upon our request.
Finally, you understand and agree that Fish.Audio, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.
Removing Your Content
You may remove your Content from the Services at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.
Removal of Content by Fish.Audio
We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of this Agreement), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
Copyright Protection
In accordance with the DMCA, we’ve adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members, or users and (2) remove and discontinue Services to repeat offenders.
（1） _Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements._ If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to Fish.Audio’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):
(a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;   
(b) Identification of works or materials being infringed; (c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Fish.Audio is capable of finding and verifying its existence;   
(d) Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;   
(e) A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and   
(f) A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
(2) _Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent._ Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:
(a) remove or disable access to the infringing material;   
(b) notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and  
(c) terminate such content provider's access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.
(3) _Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent._ If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
(a) A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;  
(b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;   
(c) A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and   
(d) Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Fish.Audio is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Fish.Audio may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Fish.Audio may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Fish.Audio’s discretion.
Please contact Fish.Audio’s Designated Agent at the following address:

We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.
You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.
The Services may contain links or connections to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Fish.Audio. When you access third-party websites or use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Fish.Audio is not responsible for such risks.
Fish.Audio has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Fish.Audio will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor, or edit the content of any third-party site or service. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.
Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Fish.Audio shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.
If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that Fish.Audio is under no obligation to become involved.

Usage Date and Content
Usage Data and Content may be used to develop, train, or enhance artificial intelligence or machine learning models that are part of Fish.Audio’s products and services, including third-party components of the Services, and you authorize Fish.Audio to process your Usage Data and Content for such purposes. Due to the nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning, information generated by these features may be incorrect or inaccurate. Services features that include artificial intelligence or machine learning models are not human and are not a substitute for human oversight. “Usage Data” means data and information about the provision, use, and performance of the Services and related offerings based on you or your use of the Services.
# Account Suspension & Termination
Terminations by You
You may stop using the Services at any time. Follow these instructions to delete the Services from your Fish.Audio Account, which involves closing your Fish.Audio Account and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.
Terminations and Suspensions by Fish.Audio
Fish.Audio is free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your Fish.Audio Account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of this Agreement. Fish.Audio has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.
Effect of Account Suspension or Termination
Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and this Agreement), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Fish.Audio.
If you have deleted your Fish.Audio Account by mistake, contact us immediately at [EAMIL] – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.
Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of this Agreement shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.
# About Software in the Services
Downloadable Software
When the Services require or include downloadable software, unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, Fish.Audio gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Fish.Audio as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Fish.Audio, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions, or you have Fish.Audio’s written permission.
Open Source
Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.
Mobile Applications
You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an “App Store”). Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to Apple App Store set forth below. You agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this Agreement apply.
Fish.Audio App available via the Apple App Store
This Agreement applies to your use of all the Services, including our iOS applications (the “Application”) available via the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) App Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application:
(a) Both you and Fish.Audio acknowledge that this Agreement is concluded between you and Fish.Audio only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content;  
(b) The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement as they are applicable to the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a user of Paid Services, you are licensed to use the Application in connection with the Services for commercial uses and otherwise to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement as they are applicable to the Services;   
(c) You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;   
(d) You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support Services with respect to the Application;   
(e) In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;   
(f) You acknowledge and agree that Fish.Audio, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;   
(g) You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Fish.Audio, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;  
(h) You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;  
(i) Both you and Fish.Audio acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and  
(j) Both you and Fish.Audio acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.
# Fees and Payments
The Services may be free, or we may charge a fee for using the Services. If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services.
Paid Services
Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Please see our [Paid Services page](https://fish.audio/plan/) for a description of the current Paid Services. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for Paid Services are deemed part of this Agreement.
Billing
If you wish to purchase Paid Services (the “Purchase”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your billing address.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete.
We may use third-party payment processors (the “Payment Processors”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processors in addition to this Agreement. By submitting your payment information, you understand that we may share that information with the Payment Processors subject to our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processors.
By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processors, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processors, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processors makes even if it has already requested or received payment. We reserve the right to reject your Purchase due to Services unavailability, or if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
Payment Method
The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processors, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.
Recurring Billing
Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you (“Subscription(s)”). By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature, and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.
We, in our sole discretion and at any time, may modify subscription fees for the Subscription(s). We will inform you of any change to your subscription fees in advance to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Any subscription fee change will become effective immediately upon publishing, or, if you have an active Subscription, at the end of your then current billing cycle. Your continued use of a Subscription after a subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the revised subscription fee amount.
Current Information Required
YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
Change in Amount Authorized
If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
Auto-Renewal for Paid Services
Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the Subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings. If you terminate a Paid Services, you may use your Subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your Subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS OR TERMINATE YOUR FISH.AUDIO ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM. PAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, FISH.AUDIO WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.
Reaffirmation of Authorization
Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Services reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Services. We may submit those charges for payment, and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Services.
Free Trials and Other Promotions
Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Services must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Services before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Services. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Services, please contact us atsupport@fish.audio. At any time before the start of your Free Trial and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms applicable to any Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
# Export Controls

In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person’s List or Entity List.

Fish.Audio and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (Fish.Audio and all such parties together, the “Fish.Audio Parties”) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the Fish.Audio Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services. The Fish.Audio Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of Services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services. THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY Fish.Audio (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Limitation of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE Fish.Audio PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO Fish.Audio IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold the Fish.Audio Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of this Agreement. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).
Third-Party Links
The Services may contain links to third-party websites and online Services that are not owned or controlled by Fish.Audio. Fish.Audio has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online Services. Be aware when you leave the Services; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy of each third-party website and online Services that you visit.
Assignment
You may not assign, delegate, or transfer this Agreement or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Fish.Audio Account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Fish.Audio’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate this Agreement and our rights and obligations without consent.
Severance
If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.
No Waiver
If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).
Interpretation
In this Agreement, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative purposes.
Governing Law
This Agreement is governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
Limitation on Legal Action
YOU AND Fish.Audio AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
Arbitration Agreement
Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Fish.Audio and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Fish.Audio. Both you and Fish.Audio acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, Fish.Audio’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.
(a) _Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement._ The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) _Costs of Arbitration._ The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Fish.Audio will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Fish.Audio will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
(c) _Small Claims Court; Infringement._ Either you or Fish.Audio may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
(d) _Waiver of Jury Trial._ YOU AND Fish.Audio WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Fish.Audio are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Fish.Audio over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND Fish.Audio WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
(e) _Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions._ ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Fish.Audio is entitled to arbitration; instead, all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
(f) _Opt-out._ You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 303 Twin Dolphin Dr, Redwood City, CA 94065 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting this Agreement. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
(g) _Exclusive Venue._ If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Fish.Audio to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Fish.Audio agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.
(h) _Severability._ If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Fish.Audio.
Miscellaneous
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Fish.Audio may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. You and Fish.Audio agree that this Agreement IS the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Fish.Audio, and that this Agreement supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Fish.Audio, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Fish.Audio in any respect whatsoever.
Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the Arbitration Agreement, you and Fish.Audio agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under this Agreement.

Think about the last time someone tried to rush you into a decision, pushing for an immediate response. But what if I told you that your greatest power lies in the pause? That calculated moment of stillness where you reclaim control, where wisdom lives in the space between reaction and response.

Then came that hat, that tall red hat, just floating down the street! It bobbed and bounced and spun around, then danced right past my feet. I rubbed my eyes and looked again, but would you believe my luck? That silly hat just winked at me, then jumped aboard a truck!

So, the key to effective noise reduction is... um... understanding signal processing at a fundamental level. We're basically teaching AI to distinguish between what humans want to hear and what they don't. It's like teaching a computer to be really good at selective hearing.

Folks, nobody knows noise better than me, believe me. These other companies, they're terrible, just terrible with noise. But we have the best technology, the absolute best. We're going to make everything so quiet, so beautiful, you won't believe it.

JARVIS, let's clean up this audio interference. Run the quantum noise cancellation algorithm I developed last night. You know, the one that makes even Cap's old war stories sound crystal clear. And yes, I did just revolutionize sound processing. Again.

When we're in the studio, I'm really particular about noise reduction. It's not just about removing unwanted sounds; it's about preserving the emotion in every note. I want you to hear every intentional breath, every string vibration, exactly as we captured it.

The auxiliary cooling system requires immediate attention. I've detected a 12.3% efficiency drop in the primary circuit. Don't worry though - I've already prepared the necessary calibration sequence. These machines are like old friends; they just need proper care.

Success in engineering isn't just about technical knowledge; it's about persistence and vision. When I started my workshop, every failed experiment taught me something new. These lessons weren't just about mechanics; they were about believing in your ideas and never stopping until they work.

During the winter of 1985, residents of a small Maine town reported seeing shadowy figures standing motionless in their yards at night. The entities would vanish when approached, leaving only deep footprints in the snow. Despite multiple witnesses, no explanation was ever found.

Folks, we're doing things nobody thought possible. The economy? Tremendous numbers, absolutely tremendous. The fake news won't tell you this, but we're setting records like nobody's ever seen before. Believe me, nobody knows success like we do.

Meow, meow! My food bowl is empty again, humans. This is completely unacceptable. I've been sitting here for five whole minutes, watching you ignore my desperate situation. The sunny spot on the windowsill can wait - food first!

在一个远离尘嚣的小镇，时间仿佛停滞在旧日的黄昏里。小镇坐落在群山环抱之中，古老的石板路铺满了青苔，每当傍晚时分，云雾便从山间徐徐升起，笼罩住镇上那几间残破的木屋。这里，仿佛被世间遗忘，只有偶尔经过的旅人才能感受到一丝奇异的宁静与神秘。 柳瑶是小镇上为数不多的年轻人之一。她从小在这里长大，却总感觉自己不属于这个地方。小镇的人们说话缓慢，眼神里充满了故事，却从不轻易讲述。

My friends, there's a darkness creeping into our world today, subtle and silent, moving through social media, through entertainment, through seemingly innocent conversations. The enemy has changed his tactics, but his goal remains the same - to blind us to the truth, to separate us from divine wisdom.

I walk through the park every morning before work. The trees sway gently in the breeze, and birds sing their morning songs. Sometimes I stop to watch a squirrel gather nuts or see dew glistening on spider webs. These quiet moments help me start my day with a clear mind.
