# What's Next: Shopping Trend Report
Aug 10,2023
Global Trends Team
General Trends
The **What’s Next Trend Report** is back! This time, we’re focusing on shopping and the incredible impact that building a loyal community can have on a brand’s business. With key trends, insights, and examples powered by creators and consumers, our **What's Next: Shopping Trend Report** provides turnkey content recommendations to inform how brands should engage their audience on TikTok when it comes to shopping.
## Brand friendships are the key to driving repeat purchases on TikTok.
Driving brand loyalty is no longer just about being human. Brands on TikTok that act as friends - listening, speaking the community's lingo, adding value to their audiences' lives, and growing together - will grab shoppers' share of mind, heart, and wallet. Like any great relationship, the findings of the What's Next: Shopping Trend Report are broken down into three key 'Layers of Love': **It’s a Match** , **Getting to Know You** , **Growing Together**.
We partnered with TikTok creator, Atikhun Kanjanakaset ([@atikhunk](https://www.tiktok.com/@atikhunk)), a fashion and anime fanatic, to get his perspective on how shopping has evolved on the platform, and how brands can connect with new audiences and creators.
**What else is in the report?**
The report dives into our broader Trend Forces in more detail, outlining:
* Trend examples that showcase emerging user behaviors and values in the shopping community
* Global research on key expectations and attitudes among TikTok users
* Product solutions and creative thought starters to help marketers plan their next shopping-related TikTok video

  * You must be able to complete the tasks and respond to creative partners in a timely manner, to avoid any delays to the project deadline.

  * If you need to ship a product for use in the video, you must abide by our shipping guidelines to ensure a timely delivery of your final assets. 
What service packages can I choose from?
We have various service packages to choose from, depending on your timeline, budget, and project needs. For example, the "net-new" service package will pair you with a creative partner to film a campaign video video from-scratch. The "remixed" service package will pair you with a creative partner to TikToks based off of your existing assets and past videos. 
We also have a few beta service offerings available, including a service specifically for mobile gaming clients and a TVC service specific to clients who have existing television advertisements that need to be converted into TikTok-native assets. Please reach out to our team for more information if you are interested in these services. 
What kinds of creative partners can I expect to be paired with through this program?
All of the creative partners in this program are certified TikTok creative service providers, who are familiar with making native TikTok videos that align with current trends. Each partner has expertise in creating high-performing user generated content (UGC) across multiple verticals and regions. 
How would you choose a creative partner for my project?
We will recommend a partner to you that best aligns with a multitude of factors, including your project goals, industry, target markets, timeline, and service requirements... 
What steps in the creative process can I expect to do within the TikTok Creative Exchange platform?
The platform will support all major steps in the process, including:
  * Create and maintain a public profile - this is how your customers can find you.
  * Matching with a client - we pair you with projects that align with what you do.
  * View and accept/reject a project brief.
  * Communicate with your client via chat throughout the project lifecycle.
  * Share files and concepts with your client.
  * Create/share creator profiles with your client for feedback.
  * View data of your client&apos;s ad campaign post-launch.
How would I get matched with clients through TikTok Creative Exchange?
Once the customer submits their project brief, they will have the option to select a creative partner for the project. Our recommendation algorithm takes into account an array of factors about the customer&apos;s project, including their industry, timeline, preferences, and target markets. We also factor in each partner&apos;s available capacity, expertise, and past performance to determine which partner to recommend for each project. During the partner selection stage, customers will always have the option to select a different partner than the recommended to them. 
What are the expected project timelines for this program?
The timeline for each project begins when the partner accepts the project from a client. At the beginning of each project, the partner will receive a scope-of-work document that outlines the target deadline to complete the project. 
We offer various service packages through the TikTok Creative Exchange program. For net-new projects, in which the partner is expected to film the video from-scratch, the turnaround time to deliver assets is 28 calendar days. Our repurposing service has a shorter timeline of 14 calendar days. We are also in the process of beta testing a couple of new offerings in the platform: One is a service specifically targeting mobile gaming customers and the other is a TVC service aimed at customers that have existing television ads that need to be converted into TikTok friendly ads. Our program is constantly introducing new service packages to meet the needs of our growing clientele, so please reach out if you would like to be included in our future offerings. Please note that these timelines are a minimum turnaround time, since clients will have the opportunity to provide a preferred delivery date when they submit their project brief.

# Advertising on TikTok - First Things to Note
Last updated: February 2025 
**Before getting started:**[TikTok Advertising Policies - Ad Creatives](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552) apply to all of TikTok's paid advertising products.
## 1. Overview
As an advertiser on TikTok, you are responsible for your [ads](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10178). This means complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations that apply to the targeted regions (including any advertising codes, such as the [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-use?lang=en), [Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines), and all of TikTok's policies found in our [Business Help Center](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/) governing the use of our services. We strive to keep up with changing times and regulations and are committed to providing a better user experience when viewing TikTok Ads.
## 2. General information
### 2.1 Understanding our policies 
We provide information about the types of products and services that can be advertised through TikTok ads. Please take a moment to review if the products or services that you intend to promote are acceptable in the desired target region.
From time to time, we may invite advertisers to participate in alpha and beta tests in select industries that are otherwise still considered prohibited or restricted. Participants are subject to confidentiality (per [8.4 of the Commercial Terms of Service](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/policy/commercial-terms-of-service)) and may be subject to additional requirements. We may choose to revoke participation or discontinue the alpha or beta tests at any time, and will strive to keep you informed if testing results in any material changes to our advertising policies.
There may be circumstances where our advertising policies might be amended by our [industry pilot program](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/about-the-tiktok-industry-pilot-program), for which we put in place appropriate risk mitigations for the opening of new industries.
For matters relating to intellectual property infringement, see [Intellectual Property Infringement Rules for Ads](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000513).
These policies serve as a guideline to review the eligibility of an advertisement placed with us by advertisers. 
### 2.2 Ad review process
As part of the TikTok ads review process, we take the following into consideration:
  * Eligibility of the promoted product or services
    * Ad content which includes:
    * Caption or text
    * Images or visual content
    * Audio content
    * Any other content that forms part of the ad that would be published to target audience
  * Targeted market and age group
  * Consistency between an ad and the landing page
  * Functionality and eligibility of landing page
In order for your ads to run smoothly and successfully on our platform, it is important for your business and ad content to be compliant with all of our policies. 
While some TikTok ads might take longer than usual for the review process to complete, most are reviewed within 24 hours. Once your ad has been approved and published, you will receive a notification. If the ad is rejected and there are changes that can be made to help publish your ad, you will be notified through Ad Group on the TikTok Ads Manager platform.
### 2.3 Actions to take if rejected
#### Edit and submit
If your TikTok Ads have been rejected due to non-compliance with our policies, review the details of the disapproval, edit the ad, and submit them for re-review.
To edit your ad:
  1. Start at your [TikTok Ads Manager](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/login/) dashboard.
  2. Select **Notifications** to review the details of rejection. It will be shown in your **Ad Group** as suggestions.
  3. Recreate or amend your ad based on the information in the received notification. Read our [How to Edit Ad Settings | TikTok Ads Manager](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/edit-ad-settings?redirected=2) article for more details.
  4. **Save** your changes. Once saved, your ad will be submitted for re-review.
#### File an appeal or get help
If you cannot edit your ads or feel it was mistakenly rejected, request a review of the decision via **Advertiser Support**. Visit our [View Campaign or Ad Status | TikTok Ads Manager](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/view-campaign-ad-group-status?redirected=2) page for more details.
  1. Start at your [**TikTok Ads Manager**](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/login/)**dashboard**.
     * From the bottom-right corner select the **?** icon.; or
     * From the top-right corner, select **Customer Support** , or from the bottom-right, select the **Help** icon.

# TikTok Coupon Terms
Last updated: February 2025 
These terms (“Coupon Terms”) govern your eligibility for and use of Coupons. Please read them carefully. The legal promoter offering the Coupon to you is: (a) if the Discounted Service (defined below) is within the TikTok Platform, the TikTok entity that provides you with the Discounted Service in accordance with the TikTok[ Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service?lang=en#terms-us); or (b) if the Discounted Service is within the TikTok For Business Platform, the TikTok entity described in the [TikTok Advertising Terms](https://ads.tiktok.com/i18n/official/article?aid=10004639) (in either case, “**us** ”, “**we** ”, “**our** ”)
To the maximum extent not prohibited by applicable law, we may, where reasonably necessary for a legitimate reason, amend or cancel any or all Coupon availability at any time in our sole discretion, and/or update, amend, or replace these Coupon Terms.
## 1. What is a Coupon?
A “Coupon” is a time-limited discount token, introductory offer token, or a form of advertising credit, that is redeemable by you for a Discounted Service at a discounted or promotional rate. Where we refer to “Discounted Service”, we mean the particular TikTok product, service, and/or digital content which is the subject of the Coupon.
## 2. How can you use a Coupon?
Coupons are subject to availability and should abide by the following terms:
  * Coupon offers can only be availed in the date and time window described in the email or a TikTok message or other notification sent to you with the coupon (“Validity Window”). After the expiry of the validity window, you will no longer be able to use the coupon.
  * Coupon can only be redeemed once per TikTok For Business Account unless otherwise expressly stated in the coupon notification.
  * To qualify for spend-match offers, only the paid bill amount or consumed top-up amount will be considered. Tax and credit costs will not be counted as part of the spending.
  * If you meet all the coupon eligibility criteria, credits will be added to your account based on the "coupon credit deadline" mentioned in the coupon notification and will be valid till the "coupon redemption deadline", also stated in the coupon notification. If the advertising credit is not fully utilized, it shall automatically expire by the "coupon redemption deadline".
  * If you qualified for the offer but did not receive the credit within the "coupon credit deadline" or if your credits are frozen, you can appeal to the TikTok Customer Support Team who will verify your eligibility and take the necessary action.
  * The advertising credits are non-refundable, non-transferable, and no other alternative ( for example Cash or other equivalent) shall be provided. The advertising credit applies to future advertising costs only. Credit cannot be applied to costs accrued before the promotional offer was applied to your TikTok Ads Manager account.
  * Coupon can only be used in accordance with Coupon usage instructions, conditions, or eligibility requirements, including any applicable maximum savings and minimum spending thresholds, for example:
    * where a Coupon is described as "Save up to $100", the maximum discount available with a purchase using that Coupon would be $100; and
    * where a Coupon is offered "If you spend $500 or more", then the Coupon only applies if you spend $500 or more on the relevant Discounted Service.
  * You will not receive a notification once the credit in your TikTok Ads Manager account is used up and any additional advertising costs will be charged to your form of payment. If you don't want to continue advertising, you can pause or stop your campaigns at any time.
  * By continuing to use TikTok Ads Manager, you are accepting the terms mentioned here and will be automatically issued advertising credit according to the above offer if you are qualified. If you do not wish to participate in this offer, please reach out to the TikTok Customer Support team.
  * Coupon offer is contingent upon the advertising account being in compliance with all the coupon terms, advertising policies, and procedures applicable to the Discounted Service.
  * The coupon offer can not be used in conjunction with any other promotional offers or discounts.
  * If you are subject to any taxes (including any penalties or interest thereon) and expenses imposed by any jurisdiction in relation to the Coupon, subject to any unwaivable local consumer law rights you may benefit from, you will be responsible for the payment of such taxes (including any related penalties or interest) to the relevant tax authority.
  * A Coupon cannot be used and is void where:
    * it is not obtained from us;
    * any part of the Coupon is resold, counterfeited, altered, defective, tampered with, or irregular in any way;
    * it is obtained through theft, fraud, deception, or unlawful means; or
    * other restrictions, or these Coupon Terms, render it unusable or invalid.
  * TikTok For Business reserves the right to remove the offer from your advertising account if any payment fails, or an offer was mistakenly applied, or your advertising account is identified as potentially high-risk, or your advertising account otherwise falls out of good standing. In such cases, if the advertising credit has already been granted, TikTok For Business reserves the right to nullify that advertising credit.
## 3. Who can use Coupons?
To be eligible for Coupons, you must:
  * have the account(s) on the TikTok Platform and/or the TikTok For Business Platform necessary for the Discounted Service;
  * be offered the Coupon by us (such as by way of TikTok message or email);
  * be able to lawfully accept and use the Coupons and the Discounted Service in your territory of residence; and
  * be of the minimum age (or above) necessary for you to be able to use the Discounted Service in your territory of residence. Please consult the terms and conditions of the Discounted Service for more information.

14 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution 
14.1 Governing Law
(a) If you are based in the United States, the laws of the state of California will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.2(b)(i).
(b) If you are based in the United Kingdom, EEA or Switzerland, the laws of England and Wales will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.3.
(c) If you are based in the Republic of Indonesia, the laws of the Republic of Indonesia will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter.
(d) If you are based outside of the United States, United Kingdom, EEA Switzerland, or the Republic of Indonesia, the laws of Singapore will govern these Commercial Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Commercial Terms or their subject matter, except as otherwise provided in Section 14.5.
14.2 **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United States**
PLEASE REVIEW THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS YOU AND TIKTOK MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AGAINST EACH OTHER ON AN _INDIVIDUAL_ BASIS IN ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION (“**ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”**).
(a) InformalResolution Process First 
If we have a dispute with you relating to or arising out of these Commercial Terms, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably. You agree to do the same for us.
The party raising a dispute will initiate this process by notifying the other in accordance with Section 15.9 of these Commercial Terms. The party receiving the notice will have 60 days to respond. If the dispute has not been resolved after the response time has expired, or within 30 days after a response has been issued, whichever is earlier, either party may initiate arbitration proceedings (or, to the extent permitted under this Arbitration Agreement, file court action) against the other. Engaging in this informal dispute resolution process is a requirement that must be completed before filing any legal action. You and TikTok agree that you both will make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute amicably before either you or TikTok files any legal action against the other, and that applicable statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process.
(b) Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
(i) Scope of Arbitration Agreement
The parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“**FAA** ”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement. 
The parties agree that after completing the informal dispute resolution process in Section 14.2(a), any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or arising out of your access to or use of the Commercial Products under these Commercial Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Commercial Terms (“**Claims** ”) will be resolved by binding individual arbitration, rather than by a court of law, except as otherwise provided below. If the parties’ dispute involves some arbitrable claims and some non-arbitrable claims, all non-arbitrable claims must be stayed until completion of the arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Claims, including those that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Arbitration Agreement. By agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, you and TikTok expressly agree not to initiate or participate in any existing or future class, collective or representative actions against the other, as set forth in Section 14.2(b)(vi).
Notwithstanding any other provision in these Commercial Terms, this Arbitration Agreement will not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (a) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction, (b) injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights, and (c) claims not subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law, after accounting for FAA preemption. Additionally, to the extent a Claim seeks public injunctive relief that is found to be a cognizable claim, such Claim must be resolved by a court or law, and stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration of any related Claims.
To the extent the parties are permitted under this Arbitration Agreement to have a matter or Claim resolved by a court of law rather than in arbitration, you and TikTok agree that such matters or Claims shall be litigated exclusively in either the United States District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such disputes.
(ii) Arbitration Rules and Forum
The arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration & Mediation (“**NAM** ”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, as discussed below) and the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, a party must satisfy the requirements pursuant to NAM’s rules. The most current version of the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and the NAM Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures are available at. If NAM is unable to arbitrate the dispute for whatever reason, a court of competent jurisdiction shall appoint the arbitrator.
The payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (and, if applicable, Mass Filing Supplement Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), except that (1) the prevailing party may seek attorneys’ fees, costs, and reimbursement of NAM filing and professional service fees if the arbitrator finds that the opposing party brought a claim, counterclaim, or defense that was either frivolous or brought with an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of arbitration; and (2) if a party timely serves an offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (or its state law equivalent), and the judgment that the other party finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, then the other party shall pay the costs, including filing fees, incurred after the offer was made.
(iii) Mass Filing and Bellwether Protocols
To increase efficiency of resolution, and subject to a decision by NAM to invoke its Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, the following protocol will apply if 100 or more similar arbitration demands are presented under these terms by or with the assistance of the same law firm or collection of law firms (“**Mass Filing** ”). For the avoidance of doubt, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures shall apply if the parties’ dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to the NAM Rules and this Mutual Arbitration Provision, to be part of a Mass Filing.
Any Mass Filing shall be subject to bellwether protocols intended to reach a fair and speedy resolution of all claims included in the Mass Filing. In any Mass Filing, NAM shall randomly select four (4) demands for arbitration to proceed, and then claimants and respondents shall each select three (3) additional demands for arbitration to proceed -- for a total of ten (10) arbitrations (“**Bellwether Arbitrations** ”). While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, all other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing shall be held in abeyance and stayed, and no party shall be responsible for paying any administrator or arbitrator fees (other than NAM’s initial filing/administrative fees, and Procedural Arbitrator fees, if applicable) while the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated. Any applicable statute of limitations regarding those demands shall remain tolled beginning when the Mass Filing claimant first provided the other party with notice of its intent to initiate informal dispute resolution, as discussed above.
The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within 120 days of its initial pre-hearing conference.
The parties agree that these bellwether proceeding protocols are designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including claims that are not selected for Bellwether Arbitration.
Following the resolution of all of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall engage in a global mediation of all remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing. The mediation shall be administered by NAM. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within 30 days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be administered by NAM pursuant to the provisions below regarding batching, along with NAM Rules and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.
If the parties are unavailable to achieve global resolution following the above Bellwether Arbitrations and global mediation, these batching provisions shall apply and NAM shall (i) consolidate the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per batch; and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator assigned per batch. This batching process shall not impact the nature of these actions as individual in nature, including that the arbitrator will make a separate determination for each claimant, nor shall it change the burden of proof on each individual claimant. You and TikTok both agree to cooperate in good faith with each other and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach, including in working with NAM to request a different fee schedule from that set forth in NAM’s relevant rules and that is more favorable to You and TikTok. Any disagreement over the batch approach will be determined with all affected parties in a single, consolidated arbitration proceeding with one arbitrator subject to the requirements of this Section and NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures.
(iv) Arbitrator Powers
The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that a court of law has the exclusive authority to determine the enforceability of any part of the Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions provision in Section 14.2(b)(vi) of this Arbitration Agreement. All disputes regarding allocation of the arbitrator’s fees and/or the arbitration fees shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and TikTok.
(v) Waiver of Jury Trial
You and TikTok waive any rights to sue in court and receive a judge or jury trial, except as otherwise specified in this Arbitration Agreement.
(vi) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions
You and TikTok agree to waive any right to have Claims decided on a class, collective or representative basis, except as set forth in this Section 14.2(b)(vi) (“Class Action Waiver”). In any case in which (1) Claims are filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) a civil court of competent jurisdiction finds all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, and/or representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. This provision does not prevent you or TikTok from participating in a settlement on a class-wide, collective, or representative basis.
(vii) Survival
This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with TikTok.
(viii) Severability
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, then (i) the unenforceable or unlawful portion will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (ii) the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect, and (iii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portion will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, severance of any portion of the Class Action Waiver in Section 14.2(b)(vi) shall not be construed to permit you or TikTok to proceed with Claims in mass arbitration, to which the parties expressly do not consent.
(c) ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD / LIMITATION ON LEGAL ACTION
YOU AND TIKTOK AGREE THAT YOU MUST INITIATE ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO A DISPUTE THAT IS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE COMMERCIAL TERMS. OTHERWISE, YOU FOREVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER, BASED ON SUCH EVENTS OR FACTS, AND SUCH CLAIM(S) OR CAUSE(S) OF ACTION ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.
14.3 **Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver – if you are based in the United Kingdom, EEA or Switzerland**
(a) Class Action Waiver 
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and TikTok acknowledge and agree that each is waiving the right to bring or participate in a class, collective, or consolidated proceeding against each other.
(b) Exceptions to Mediation and Arbitration
Nothing in this Section 14.3 shall: (i) prevent TikTok from applying to any court or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction for interim relief of any kind including, without limitation, injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's confidentiality rights or copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights; (ii) require either party to arbitrate claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law (and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over such claims); or (iii) prevent either party from bringing a claim in a court of law where it has a legal right to do so without prior mediation and/or arbitration (as applicable) under applicable law, unless that legal right can be given up or changed by contractual agreement.
(c) Procedure
Subject to the exceptions in Section 14.3(b), if you have any claim or dispute against TikTok arising out of or in connection with these Commercial Terms, including any question regarding its existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity, the parties shall follow the procedure set out in this Section 14.3(c): 
(i) Either party shall give to the other party written notice of the dispute, setting out its nature and full particulars, together with relevant supporting documents, and the parties shall agree to attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve such dispute by way of confidential discussions between the parties. The notice of dispute to TikTok must be sent to Kaleidoscope, 4 Lindsey Street, London, United Kingdom, EC1A 9HP, Attn: Legal Department and will be deemed to have been received upon delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, this notice provision applies notwithstanding the general notice provisions in Section 15.9.
(ii) If the dispute has not been settled within 30 days of the date the written notice issued pursuant to Section 14.3(c)(i) was deemed received, or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, then the parties will refer the dispute to mediation under the International Chamber of Commerce (“**ICC** ”) Mediation Rules or the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“**CEDR** ”) Model Mediation Procedure (as chosen by you). Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of referral of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by the ICC or CEDR (as applicable). 
(iii) If the dispute has not been settled within 60 days following the filing of a request for mediation or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, such dispute will thereafter be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC, which are incorporated by reference into this Section. 
(iv) Unless the parties agree otherwise, there will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the ICC), the arbitration will take place in London, England, and the arbitration will be conducted in English.
14.4 **Arbitration Agreement - if you are based in the Republic of Indonesia**
(a) You and TikTok agree that if either party has any claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with these Commercial Terms, including any question regarding its existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity ("**Dispute** "), either party shall give to the other party written notice of the Dispute, setting out its nature and full particulars, together with relevant supporting documents, and the parties shall agree to attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve such Dispute by way of confidential discussions between the parties.

For the avoidance of doubt, this notice provision applies notwithstanding the general notice provisions in Section 15.9.
(b) If the Dispute has not been settled within 30 days of the date the written notice under Section 14.4(a) was deemed received, or within such other period as the parties may agree in writing, then the parties will refer the dispute to be finally settled by arbitration administered by Badan Arbitrase Nasional Indonesia ("**BANI** ") located at Wahana Graha Lt. 1&2, Jalan Mampang Prapatan No. 2, Jakarta 12760 as at the date of these Commercial Terms. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of BANI for the time being in force ("**Rules** "), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Section except where such Rules conflict with the provisions of this Section, in which event the provisions of this Section shall prevail. The number of arbitrators will be one. The seat and venue of arbitration shall be Jakarta. The language of arbitration shall be English.
(c) You and TikTok shall request the arbitrator to include in his/her award an authorization to the party in whose favor the award is issued to register at the relevant District Court in Indonesia in accordance with Law No. 30 of 1999 on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution ("**Arbitration Law** ").
(d) You and TikTok agree that the BANI arbitration award is final, binding and cannot be disputed by you or TikTok. You and TikTok hereby waive, to the fullest extent possible, any right to appeal or challenge any arbitral award, as well as any immunity or privilege that you or TikTok may have in relation to the validity or enforceability of an arbitral award or any decision relating to the same. We and you also agree to waive the applicability of Article 48 of the Arbitration Law such that the arbitration needs to be completed within a specified timeframe.
14.5 **Arbitration Agreement - if you are based outside of the United States, United Kingdom, EEA, Switzerland and the Republic of Indonesia**
(a) Class Action Waiver

(c) Procedure

15 Miscellaneous
15.1 **Modifications to Commercial Terms**. TikTok may modify these Commercial Terms from time to time, so we encourage you to check them regularly for any updates. If TikTok makes material changes to the Commercial Terms then, other than in exceptional circumstances, including in response to urgent changes in security, safety, legal or regulatory requirements, TikTok will give you reasonable advance notice of material changes which will impact you, and the date they will come into force, such as by email or notifications in your Commercial Account. If you do not agree to the modified Commercial Terms, please cease all access or use of the Commercial Products. Otherwise, your continued access or use of the Commercial Products after the updates have become effective will be deemed acceptance of the modified Commercial Terms.

15.2 **Entire Agreement**. These Commercial Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and TikTok relating to the subject matter of these Commercial Terms and replaces any prior agreements between you and TikTok in relation to the subject matter of these Commercial Terms.

Nothing in this Section, however, will exclude any liability on the part of either party for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
15.3 **Severability**. Except as otherwise provided in Section 14.2(b)(viii), if any court of law, having jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Commercial Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Commercial Terms without affecting the rest of the Commercial Terms, and the remaining provisions of the Commercial Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

This summer, TikTok welcomed a new class of interns who brought their unique skills and enthusiasm to a variety of teams and to the platform. Reya, Oliver, and Geoffery, based in Seattle, London, and Sydney respectively, spoke to us about their internships conducting research and implementing cutting-edge technologies, as well as growing and owning their own ideas during their time on their teams.Tell us about the work you do: What does a typical day look like for you?Reya: I'm a machine learning engineer intern, and I work as a part of the Supply Chain and Logistics team in TikTok Shop. A typical day for me is looking at a lot of graphs, analyzing data, coding, fixing bugs, and reading research papers! I really enjoy the freedom we have to explore new ideas and put them into practice. Oliver: I work in Global Business Marketing. I tackle a variety of tasks each day, like creating campaign impact reports, planning agendas, and conducting research. I work on projects such as developing content maps and designing feedback surveys. What I love most is solving problems creatively, whether it's coming up with innovative TikTok merchandise ideas or gathering feedback to shape future projects. My efforts support the team in staying organised and productive.Geoffrey: As a Multimedia Research and Development intern on the Video Cloud Infrastructure team, my typical day at TikTok varies greatly! Some days, I focus solely on development work, while on others, I engage in detailed project discussions and code reviews. During tougher days, I tackle online issues related to streaming. I particularly enjoy the development aspect of my work because designing the infrastructure challenges my critical thinking skills, requiring me to assess whether a design is scalable or if an algorithm is efficient enough.What is the biggest highlight of your work so far? Reya: You know those delivery date ranges you see when you’re shopping? My main project involves improving the accuracy of those predictions, aiming to narrow down the ranges so you don’t have to wait as long for your favorite products. It’s really exciting to work on something where you can directly see your impact on users!Oliver: I worked closely on a project to map out the content for the second half of the year. This involved collaborating with the regional creative lead and consulting with each local market lead. Our goal was to create a new, centralized space where each local market could easily access the content they need and identify the appropriate contacts for further consultation. Once we built it, we started using it within our bi-weekly team meeting!Geoffrey: One of my most exciting projects is streaming cost optimization. TikTok has a very high volume of streaming traffic, which presents a lot of unique challenges to be solved, such as quality of service and streaming costs. My project has personally taught me a lot about streaming infrastructure, API methods, and databases. I received a lot of very helpful feedback from my team members about my code, which improves my code quality and critical thinking. What do you like the most about working at TikTok?Reya: I love that we have a culture that de-empathsizes hierarchy; I can reach out to anyone on the team without worrying about titles or positions. I don’t even know everyone’s titles on my team since they aren’t listed anywhere on their profile. We just focus on what projects everyone is working on, and that’s all that matters. I used to be a bit hesitant about asking questions or reaching out for help when I encounter problems, but at TikTok, my mentor and manager frequently checked in with me to ensure I wasn't facing any issues. This support has made me feel so comfortable that now I don't even think twice before reaching out to anyone.Geoffrey: My favourite part about working at TikTok is the work culture. My mentors always ensure that I am up to date with information, and I always receive constructive feedback on my work, which allows me to improve my skills. We have done several team bonding activities like basketball, dinners, and even board games to strengthen our relationship as people. What advice would you give to someone who is interested in interning at TikTok?Reya: It’s a fast-paced tech environment with incredible people, so having a learning mindset and embracing new, creative ideas is key. Stay updated by reading tech blogs and keeping an eye on the latest trends. Oliver: Show your passion for creativity, no matter what team or department you are in. Go above and beyond in building up a network, cross-functionally. Come into it with a curious mindset. Be open to learning new things. During my internship at TikTok, I learned the importance of adaptability, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement.Geoffrey: Go for it! TikTok is a great opportunity to learn from industry professionals, and get guidance and feedback from your mentor. There will be many new, interesting things to learn, and many invaluable opportunities to grow your skillset and connections. Working at TikTok has not only helped me develop fundamental skills in code development and practices, but has also given me deep insight into the software industry. As a software engineer, I understand a lot more about how business decisions are made, and how they affect clients/users. Across teams, TikTok interns get the chance to learn, grow, and cultivate inspiration that's infinite. Interested in applying for the next internship season? Don't hesitate! Submit your application now and take the first step towards an enriching internship experience.  2024-09-27 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7419010360248109363)

At TikTok, we're dedicated to discovering and nurturing early career talents. One of the ways we do this is by going straight to the source: students completing their higher education and beginning to define their professional goals. That's why this July, we worked with the University of Sydney in Australia to sponsor Codefest. Codefest is an annual coding competition where students from the school's graduate program come together to sharpen their skills, as well as connect with peers and hear presentations from industry leaders in the fields of technology, Research &amp; Development, and AI. Members of TikTok's DataAILab team attended Codefest to talk about creativity in coding, how their work impacts every aspect of TikTok's platform, and what they're looking for in Early Career hires. "Codefest sets a stage for university students to tackle real-world problems, ranging from finding a parking spot to translating sign languages," says Maisie Wang, a human resources partner on the team. She helped run a booth at Codefest and connected with attendees to chat about day-to-day life at TikTok. "Codefest bridges the gap between academy and industry. The students get to think about how to convert the knowledge and skills they learn at school to innovative solutions that contribute to our community. "Employees that work on DataAILab are responsible for developing and maintaining the series of infrastructure systems that make TikTok work. These include the product recommendation algorithms, large language models, and the transcoding and decoding involved in streaming and uploading. We are also responsible for Risk Engineering &amp; Research, Big Data R&amp;D, and Open Platform technology." The team hiring in the Sydney office has a particular focus on video architecture. This work is what brought together TikTok with the University of Sydney. Professor Zhiyong Wang, who teaches computer science at the school, connected with TikTok to discuss the theme of 2024 Codefest; "Creativity in Coding". Professor Wang invited TikTok to participate in the event, because creativity is something the DataAILab team infuses into everything they do. "Not only is the technology we build innovative in its own right," says Maisie Wang, "but without a very stable infrastructure built out, the creativity that all our users display would have nothing to live on!"Going into the specifics of what the Sydney DataAILab team has to offer was Leo Niu, a Site Reliability Engineer. Niu gave a presentation to students about his work and TikTok's goals for the team."On a granular level, we develop and maintain systems to allow users to watch videos and livestreams smoothly and on demand," says Niu. His presentation touched on the creation of TikTok's livestreaming capabilities, and an overview of global video systems, where everything from the ability to upload to content, to pressing play and pause are carefully constructed. "In a broader sense, we provide the best possible user experience."Leo Niu presenting to students at Codefest.He described meeting a group of students working on a project to utilize AI technology to translate Auslan (Australian Sign Language) into English. Coincidentally, the DataAILab team is also working on projects to improve AI translations. This is one of many instances where Codefest gave TikTok teammates a chance to meet prospective early career talent who were passionate about the same things they were."It's very rare for students to have an opportunity to ask employees of a platform they admire in-depth questions about the work," he says. Not only did the work the DataAILab team shared at Codefest interest students, so did TikTok's culture and early career opportunities. "Young people care about their own growth," says Mingfei Hao, another video architecture teammate. "TikTok provides opportunities for them to grow even in an internship or entry-level position. They'll be mentored, and given the freedom to direct and cultivate their own career." "For TikTok, we are always talent-hungry, especially for talents with strong coding skills," says Niu. "Codefest serves a great opportunity for us to connect with early career talent and introduce them to the innovative work we do"Interested in a career on TikTok's DataAILab team?

Small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) are the backbone of commerce at Tiktok. According to Oxford Economics, TikTok SMBs generate thousands of jobs for sellers globally, and contributed $24.2 billion to the US economy in 2023. For the people who make up the SMB team, supporting these businesses through building relationships, and equipping clients with the tools needed to succeed, is one of the highlights of the job. We spoke to Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine about what it takes to keep businesses thriving and users satisfied. "Being an SMB Account Manager at TikTok is all about client relationships," says Fabio Arendt, who is based in the Hamburg office. "We’re the go-to people for anything our clients need, whether it’s solving last-minute challenges or perfecting their campaign strategies. It's more than just troubleshooting a technical issue. We help these businesses reach customers and generate awareness of their brands, products, and services. Businesses all over the world depend on TikTok’s unique ability to help them reach otherwise unreachable customers."While Arendt manages established accounts, Justine Abdallah helps start new ones off on the right foot. With a concentration on brand strategy, her work includes providing new businesses with material resources to help spark creativity and begin building their campaigns on TikTok. "On the acquisition team, you're the first face a new customer or a new client sees when onboarding," she says. "So we want them to be fully equipped from Day 1."Lorenzo Bierhuys helps SMBs liaise with agencies that are also working with clients to develop eye-catching business campaigns for the platform. "What I really like about this job is that you get to work with colleagues who have specialized market knowledge,” Bierhuys says, noting his team is responsible for locations across Europe, including France, Italy and Spain. "It’s great being able to work together with, and learn from people working across different geographies.""We put everything in place to ensure they're successful on TikTok and empowered to unlock more of their full potential," adds Natalie Rois, who work on the team in Dublin. One of the team's projects to support that goal involved regional growth in Europe and the Middle East. Abdallah and coworkers helped organize an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to pitch campaign ideas to customers. "Helping small and medium businesses grow is so rewarding, because you get to watch them blossom," says Abdallah. "Sometimes we have a client with zero idea what advertising on TikTok looks like, zero idea how it's going to work. So you get to be with them every step of the way, and see them become success stories." While helping businesses succeed online drove all four of them to join the team, the culture of TikTok is why Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine have all stayed. "We're constantly learning from each other," says Arendt. "It’s funny how, by simply listening with intent, I end up learning far more than I would by relying on the knowledge I already have. Add to that the international environment we thrive in, where diverse viewpoints are celebrated, and it’s a recipe for empathy and understanding. Every conversation sharpens my ability to truly see things from others’ perspectives, making me more attuned to each client’s unique needs."The team doesn't only support clients and businesses; it supports the people who make TikTok what it is. Arendt went on to describe a particularly empowering and supportive working culture, especially when he transferred from the Dublin office to Hamburg. "When the company planted its flag in Central Europe with a shiny new satellite office in Hamburg, I found myself toying with the idea of heading back home to Germany. Before I let the daydreams of the Baltic Sea take over, I had a heart-to-heart with my line manager about the potential move, my career goals, and, of course, my personal growth. Her response? Total support from start to finish. Fast forward a bit, and voilà—I traded Dublin's rain for Hamburg's!""What stands out a lot if you compare scaling your projects at TikTok to a similar company," says Bierhuys. “Cross-functional collaboration is definitely encouraged. If there’s value my team can add, we get a lot of freedom to get involved in co-owned projects and we’ve definitely made a positive impact to the organization through these partnerships.""You'll never be bored," says Abdallah. "Every day there's a new feature to try out, or a new client, or a new campaign." She mentions one of the company's core values, Always Day 1, which means maintaining an entrepreneurial and enthusiastic mindset, no matter how long you've been with the company. "We adapt and test constantly, and when something isn't working, we work as a team to find a solution." Rois agrees. “We have a serious test and learn culture here. We try, identify errors and fix processes as we progress.

Since then, I've held a variety of roles focusing on trust and safety policy in the United States, and today I'm the Global Head of Regional Product Policy. From the start, my work involved rationalizing the safety policy framework and thinking through what our safety principles were, so that we could develop the safety policies needed to create a joyful experience on TikTok.I came to TikTok from the NYU Stern School of Business, where I worked for the Center for Business and Human Rights. We looked at how we could leverage corporate commitments to advance human rights in a range of different sectors, from fast fashion to labor, and all the ways you can help people at scale. If you have an ambassador to Denmark, but not an ambassador to Walmart on matters of fast fashion, then are you really looking to solve the problem in the right way with all the resources available to you? Then, I pivoted to the technology sector, where the traditional concerns were data privacy and freedom of expression. As I dove into it, I saw that there were a whole host of issues that policies hadn't really been created for yet. For example, what does hate speech and the evolution of hate speech really look like on social media platforms? What do conversations about mental health and body image look like? What are we doing to protect minors from things that they could be so easily exposed to on the internet, that they're not really developmentally ready for?Joining TikTok, I was excited by the opportunity to see what a new global platform could do when it comes to being safety-first in tech. The way that everyone from CEO Shou Chew on down works to make sure people on the platform feel like they belong and can connect to the people that are most impactful to them. The diversity of content that we see on the platform is one of our strengths; you can find anything and relate to people globally. The platform has grown so much from what it originally was. With the addition of livestreaming and monetization, we've had a really wonderful opportunity to build new policies to help protect people in every aspect of the platform.A lot of the policies we've put in place that I'm most proud of answer the question, "how do we manage safety concerns and building a place where people can authentically be themselves?" We want people to talk about challenges that they've overcome, and what their life experience has been, but also be mindful at when that crosses the line into glorification and promotion. For example, any ads that promote weight management products cannot promote a negative body image or negative relationship with food. We partnered with the National Eating Disorder Association to connect people with resources to help anyone who may be struggling with body image issues if they interact with harmful content.The power of the community has always been so strong on TikTok, and we want it to be a place where people can be met on their level. The content for those under eighteen will be different than that for adults, to give another example. Educational content is really great, but sometimes only relevant or appropriate for adults. So content classification becomes really important there, and people who are younger and still on their developmental journey aren't exposed to content that might not be appropriate for them. What I've loved about working on policy here has been that we don't have a one-size-fits-all policy framework that we export across all the markets that we serve. Everything is tailored to the relevant needs of different groups and locations. Above all, working on policy at TikTok is a really rewarding way to feel like I am making an impact globally.

As a global team, GSO has offices in places like New York, Washington DC, Dublin, San Jose, and Singapore. The team focuses on issues like cybersecurity, data protection, incident response, and certifying compliance with global regulations wherever TikTok operates.Another major role that GSO plays is to constantly monitor TikTok's apps, systems, and APIs to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by bad actors and potentially harm TikTok or our community. The team in charge, known as Vulnerability Management (VM), receives reports on these potential issues from a variety of sources, triages the findings, and then works with the appropriate product teams to remediate them as quickly as possible in order to keep our community safe. Suhana Hyder, who leads the team, explains their work simply, "I always feel like we're superheroes. We're trying to find issues and get them fixed before they can impact the platform or our users. It's a very exciting feeling." TikTok's own security superheroes receive vulnerability reports from a variety of sources, like internal and external penetration testing teams. For the past four years, they have also worked with HackerOne, a trusted partner company that provides security researchers or ethical hackers with a platform to report vulnerabilities to companies like TikTok. These researchers receive bounties for valid "bug" they find in our system.In late July and early August of 2024, the VM team held a Live Hacking Event through HackerOne, following up on a similar effort last year as part of the Ambassador World Cup. During this two week event, TikTok's bug bounties were increased, the scope of work was narrowed, and 50 of the world's top ethical hackers from 29 countries probed our systems to help us find and patch vulnerabilities. Of over 300 reports that were submitted, more than 100 were valid vulnerabilities,and we awarded a total of $721,695 in bounties to the researchers who helped us keep the TikTok platform safe. Zhaohong Liu from the VM team described the live hacking event, "This was such a great activity. We were very happy to engage with these top level hackers in person. We saw so many high-quality reports, even more so than we see in our main bug bounty program. We also received a lot of valuable support and collaboration from crossfunctional teams to make this event possible." Due to the increased volume in reports and the shortened timeline, VM worked with other internal teams like TikTok Security Assurance, Singapore Security Assurance, and the Global Security Organization's Attack Surface Management team, which triaged about 50% of the reports that came in during the live hacking event.Highlighting the crossfunctional collaboration, Suhana Hyder said, "We could not have done this without them. This live hacking event yielded so many valid reports, and that level of triaging required us to be available 24 hours a day, five days a week. Security is a team sport, and we're grateful for the collaboration."The vulnerabilities found and patched through this effort help to protect not only the TikTok platform, but also its global community. Singapore technical team lead Ethan Liu put it plainly, "Knowing that we patched another loophole, another vulnerability that could have impacted our platform is the most rewarding part of our job. I love knowing that we fix problems before bad actors can use them to hack our systems. I love knowing that we're contributing not only to the company, but also to the entire TikTok community.

This summer, TikTok welcomed a new class of interns who brought their unique skills and enthusiasm to a variety of teams and to the platform. Reya, Oliver, and Geoffery, based in Seattle, London, and Sydney respectively, spoke to us about their internships conducting research and implementing cutting-edge technologies, as well as growing and owning their own ideas during their time on their teams.Tell us about the work you do: What does a typical day look like for you?Reya: I'm a machine learning engineer intern, and I work as a part of the Supply Chain and Logistics team in TikTok Shop. A typical day for me is looking at a lot of graphs, analyzing data, coding, fixing bugs, and reading research papers! I really enjoy the freedom we have to explore new ideas and put them into practice. Oliver: I work in Global Business Marketing. I tackle a variety of tasks each day, like creating campaign impact reports, planning agendas, and conducting research. I work on projects such as developing content maps and designing feedback surveys. What I love most is solving problems creatively, whether it's coming up with innovative TikTok merchandise ideas or gathering feedback to shape future projects. My efforts support the team in staying organised and productive.Geoffrey: As a Multimedia Research and Development intern on the Video Cloud Infrastructure team, my typical day at TikTok varies greatly! Some days, I focus solely on development work, while on others, I engage in detailed project discussions and code reviews. During tougher days, I tackle online issues related to streaming. I particularly enjoy the development aspect of my work because designing the infrastructure challenges my critical thinking skills, requiring me to assess whether a design is scalable or if an algorithm is efficient enough.What is the biggest highlight of your work so far? Reya: You know those delivery date ranges you see when you’re shopping? My main project involves improving the accuracy of those predictions, aiming to narrow down the ranges so you don’t have to wait as long for your favorite products. It’s really exciting to work on something where you can directly see your impact on users!Oliver: I worked closely on a project to map out the content for the second half of the year. This involved collaborating with the regional creative lead and consulting with each local market lead. Our goal was to create a new, centralized space where each local market could easily access the content they need and identify the appropriate contacts for further consultation. Once we built it, we started using it within our bi-weekly team meeting!Geoffrey: One of my most exciting projects is streaming cost optimization. TikTok has a very high volume of streaming traffic, which presents a lot of unique challenges to be solved, such as quality of service and streaming costs. My project has personally taught me a lot about streaming infrastructure, API methods, and databases. I received a lot of very helpful feedback from my team members about my code, which improves my code quality and critical thinking. What do you like the most about working at TikTok?Reya: I love that we have a culture that de-empathsizes hierarchy; I can reach out to anyone on the team without worrying about titles or positions. I don’t even know everyone’s titles on my team since they aren’t listed anywhere on their profile. We just focus on what projects everyone is working on, and that’s all that matters. I used to be a bit hesitant about asking questions or reaching out for help when I encounter problems, but at TikTok, my mentor and manager frequently checked in with me to ensure I wasn't facing any issues. This support has made me feel so comfortable that now I don't even think twice before reaching out to anyone.Geoffrey: My favourite part about working at TikTok is the work culture. My mentors always ensure that I am up to date with information, and I always receive constructive feedback on my work, which allows me to improve my skills. We have done several team bonding activities like basketball, dinners, and even board games to strengthen our relationship as people. What advice would you give to someone who is interested in interning at TikTok?Reya: It’s a fast-paced tech environment with incredible people, so having a learning mindset and embracing new, creative ideas is key. Stay updated by reading tech blogs and keeping an eye on the latest trends. Oliver: Show your passion for creativity, no matter what team or department you are in. Go above and beyond in building up a network, cross-functionally. Come into it with a curious mindset. Be open to learning new things. During my internship at TikTok, I learned the importance of adaptability, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement.Geoffrey: Go for it! TikTok is a great opportunity to learn from industry professionals, and get guidance and feedback from your mentor. There will be many new, interesting things to learn, and many invaluable opportunities to grow your skillset and connections. Working at TikTok has not only helped me develop fundamental skills in code development and practices, but has also given me deep insight into the software industry. As a software engineer, I understand a lot more about how business decisions are made, and how they affect clients/users. Across teams, TikTok interns get the chance to learn, grow, and cultivate inspiration that's infinite. Interested in applying for the next internship season? Don't hesitate! Submit your application now and take the first step towards an enriching internship experience.  2024-09-27 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7419010360248109363)

At TikTok, we're dedicated to discovering and nurturing early career talents. One of the ways we do this is by going straight to the source: students completing their higher education and beginning to define their professional goals. That's why this July, we worked with the University of Sydney in Australia to sponsor Codefest. Codefest is an annual coding competition where students from the school's graduate program come together to sharpen their skills, as well as connect with peers and hear presentations from industry leaders in the fields of technology, Research &amp; Development, and AI. Members of TikTok's DataAILab team attended Codefest to talk about creativity in coding, how their work impacts every aspect of TikTok's platform, and what they're looking for in Early Career hires. "Codefest sets a stage for university students to tackle real-world problems, ranging from finding a parking spot to translating sign languages," says Maisie Wang, a human resources partner on the team. She helped run a booth at Codefest and connected with attendees to chat about day-to-day life at TikTok. "Codefest bridges the gap between academy and industry. The students get to think about how to convert the knowledge and skills they learn at school to innovative solutions that contribute to our community. "Employees that work on DataAILab are responsible for developing and maintaining the series of infrastructure systems that make TikTok work. These include the product recommendation algorithms, large language models, and the transcoding and decoding involved in streaming and uploading. We are also responsible for Risk Engineering &amp; Research, Big Data R&amp;D, and Open Platform technology." The team hiring in the Sydney office has a particular focus on video architecture. This work is what brought together TikTok with the University of Sydney. Professor Zhiyong Wang, who teaches computer science at the school, connected with TikTok to discuss the theme of 2024 Codefest; "Creativity in Coding". Professor Wang invited TikTok to participate in the event, because creativity is something the DataAILab team infuses into everything they do. "Not only is the technology we build innovative in its own right," says Maisie Wang, "but without a very stable infrastructure built out, the creativity that all our users display would have nothing to live on!"Going into the specifics of what the Sydney DataAILab team has to offer was Leo Niu, a Site Reliability Engineer. Niu gave a presentation to students about his work and TikTok's goals for the team."On a granular level, we develop and maintain systems to allow users to watch videos and livestreams smoothly and on demand," says Niu. His presentation touched on the creation of TikTok's livestreaming capabilities, and an overview of global video systems, where everything from the ability to upload to content, to pressing play and pause are carefully constructed. "In a broader sense, we provide the best possible user experience."Leo Niu presenting to students at Codefest.He described meeting a group of students working on a project to utilize AI technology to translate Auslan (Australian Sign Language) into English. Coincidentally, the DataAILab team is also working on projects to improve AI translations. This is one of many instances where Codefest gave TikTok teammates a chance to meet prospective early career talent who were passionate about the same things they were."It's very rare for students to have an opportunity to ask employees of a platform they admire in-depth questions about the work," he says. Not only did the work the DataAILab team shared at Codefest interest students, so did TikTok's culture and early career opportunities. "Young people care about their own growth," says Mingfei Hao, another video architecture teammate. "TikTok provides opportunities for them to grow even in an internship or entry-level position. They'll be mentored, and given the freedom to direct and cultivate their own career." "For TikTok, we are always talent-hungry, especially for talents with strong coding skills," says Niu. "Codefest serves a great opportunity for us to connect with early career talent and introduce them to the innovative work we do"Interested in a career on TikTok's DataAILab team?

Small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) are the backbone of commerce at Tiktok. According to Oxford Economics, TikTok SMBs generate thousands of jobs for sellers globally, and contributed $24.2 billion to the US economy in 2023. For the people who make up the SMB team, supporting these businesses through building relationships, and equipping clients with the tools needed to succeed, is one of the highlights of the job. We spoke to Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine about what it takes to keep businesses thriving and users satisfied. "Being an SMB Account Manager at TikTok is all about client relationships," says Fabio Arendt, who is based in the Hamburg office. "We’re the go-to people for anything our clients need, whether it’s solving last-minute challenges or perfecting their campaign strategies. It's more than just troubleshooting a technical issue. We help these businesses reach customers and generate awareness of their brands, products, and services. Businesses all over the world depend on TikTok’s unique ability to help them reach otherwise unreachable customers."While Arendt manages established accounts, Justine Abdallah helps start new ones off on the right foot. With a concentration on brand strategy, her work includes providing new businesses with material resources to help spark creativity and begin building their campaigns on TikTok. "On the acquisition team, you're the first face a new customer or a new client sees when onboarding," she says. "So we want them to be fully equipped from Day 1."Lorenzo Bierhuys helps SMBs liaise with agencies that are also working with clients to develop eye-catching business campaigns for the platform. "What I really like about this job is that you get to work with colleagues who have specialized market knowledge,” Bierhuys says, noting his team is responsible for locations across Europe, including France, Italy and Spain. "It’s great being able to work together with, and learn from people working across different geographies.""We put everything in place to ensure they're successful on TikTok and empowered to unlock more of their full potential," adds Natalie Rois, who work on the team in Dublin. One of the team's projects to support that goal involved regional growth in Europe and the Middle East. Abdallah and coworkers helped organize an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to pitch campaign ideas to customers. "Helping small and medium businesses grow is so rewarding, because you get to watch them blossom," says Abdallah. "Sometimes we have a client with zero idea what advertising on TikTok looks like, zero idea how it's going to work. So you get to be with them every step of the way, and see them become success stories." While helping businesses succeed online drove all four of them to join the team, the culture of TikTok is why Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine have all stayed. "We're constantly learning from each other," says Arendt. "It’s funny how, by simply listening with intent, I end up learning far more than I would by relying on the knowledge I already have.

This summer, TikTok welcomed a new class of interns who brought their unique skills and enthusiasm to a variety of teams and to the platform. Reya, Oliver, and Geoffery, based in Seattle, London, and Sydney respectively, spoke to us about their internships conducting research and implementing cutting-edge technologies, as well as growing and owning their own ideas during their time on their teams.Tell us about the work you do: What does a typical day look like for you?Reya: I'm a machine learning engineer intern, and I work as a part of the Supply Chain and Logistics team in TikTok Shop. A typical day for me is looking at a lot of graphs, analyzing data, coding, fixing bugs, and reading research papers! I really enjoy the freedom we have to explore new ideas and put them into practice. Oliver: I work in Global Business Marketing. I tackle a variety of tasks each day, like creating campaign impact reports, planning agendas, and conducting research. I work on projects such as developing content maps and designing feedback surveys. What I love most is solving problems creatively, whether it's coming up with innovative TikTok merchandise ideas or gathering feedback to shape future projects. My efforts support the team in staying organised and productive.Geoffrey: As a Multimedia Research and Development intern on the Video Cloud Infrastructure team, my typical day at TikTok varies greatly! Some days, I focus solely on development work, while on others, I engage in detailed project discussions and code reviews. During tougher days, I tackle online issues related to streaming. I particularly enjoy the development aspect of my work because designing the infrastructure challenges my critical thinking skills, requiring me to assess whether a design is scalable or if an algorithm is efficient enough.What is the biggest highlight of your work so far? Reya: You know those delivery date ranges you see when you’re shopping? My main project involves improving the accuracy of those predictions, aiming to narrow down the ranges so you don’t have to wait as long for your favorite products. It’s really exciting to work on something where you can directly see your impact on users!Oliver: I worked closely on a project to map out the content for the second half of the year. This involved collaborating with the regional creative lead and consulting with each local market lead. Our goal was to create a new, centralized space where each local market could easily access the content they need and identify the appropriate contacts for further consultation. Once we built it, we started using it within our bi-weekly team meeting!Geoffrey: One of my most exciting projects is streaming cost optimization. TikTok has a very high volume of streaming traffic, which presents a lot of unique challenges to be solved, such as quality of service and streaming costs. My project has personally taught me a lot about streaming infrastructure, API methods, and databases. I received a lot of very helpful feedback from my team members about my code, which improves my code quality and critical thinking. What do you like the most about working at TikTok?Reya: I love that we have a culture that de-empathsizes hierarchy; I can reach out to anyone on the team without worrying about titles or positions. I don’t even know everyone’s titles on my team since they aren’t listed anywhere on their profile. We just focus on what projects everyone is working on, and that’s all that matters. I used to be a bit hesitant about asking questions or reaching out for help when I encounter problems, but at TikTok, my mentor and manager frequently checked in with me to ensure I wasn't facing any issues. This support has made me feel so comfortable that now I don't even think twice before reaching out to anyone.Geoffrey: My favourite part about working at TikTok is the work culture. My mentors always ensure that I am up to date with information, and I always receive constructive feedback on my work, which allows me to improve my skills. We have done several team bonding activities like basketball, dinners, and even board games to strengthen our relationship as people. What advice would you give to someone who is interested in interning at TikTok?Reya: It’s a fast-paced tech environment with incredible people, so having a learning mindset and embracing new, creative ideas is key. Stay updated by reading tech blogs and keeping an eye on the latest trends. Oliver: Show your passion for creativity, no matter what team or department you are in. Go above and beyond in building up a network, cross-functionally. Come into it with a curious mindset. Be open to learning new things. During my internship at TikTok, I learned the importance of adaptability, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement.Geoffrey: Go for it! TikTok is a great opportunity to learn from industry professionals, and get guidance and feedback from your mentor. There will be many new, interesting things to learn, and many invaluable opportunities to grow your skillset and connections. Working at TikTok has not only helped me develop fundamental skills in code development and practices, but has also given me deep insight into the software industry. As a software engineer, I understand a lot more about how business decisions are made, and how they affect clients/users. Across teams, TikTok interns get the chance to learn, grow, and cultivate inspiration that's infinite. Interested in applying for the next internship season? Don't hesitate! Submit your application now and take the first step towards an enriching internship experience.  2024-09-27 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7419010360248109363)

At TikTok, we're dedicated to discovering and nurturing early career talents. One of the ways we do this is by going straight to the source: students completing their higher education and beginning to define their professional goals. That's why this July, we worked with the University of Sydney in Australia to sponsor Codefest. Codefest is an annual coding competition where students from the school's graduate program come together to sharpen their skills, as well as connect with peers and hear presentations from industry leaders in the fields of technology, Research &amp; Development, and AI. Members of TikTok's DataAILab team attended Codefest to talk about creativity in coding, how their work impacts every aspect of TikTok's platform, and what they're looking for in Early Career hires. "Codefest sets a stage for university students to tackle real-world problems, ranging from finding a parking spot to translating sign languages," says Maisie Wang, a human resources partner on the team. She helped run a booth at Codefest and connected with attendees to chat about day-to-day life at TikTok. "Codefest bridges the gap between academy and industry. The students get to think about how to convert the knowledge and skills they learn at school to innovative solutions that contribute to our community. "Employees that work on DataAILab are responsible for developing and maintaining the series of infrastructure systems that make TikTok work. These include the product recommendation algorithms, large language models, and the transcoding and decoding involved in streaming and uploading. We are also responsible for Risk Engineering &amp; Research, Big Data R&amp;D, and Open Platform technology." The team hiring in the Sydney office has a particular focus on video architecture. This work is what brought together TikTok with the University of Sydney. Professor Zhiyong Wang, who teaches computer science at the school, connected with TikTok to discuss the theme of 2024 Codefest; "Creativity in Coding". Professor Wang invited TikTok to participate in the event, because creativity is something the DataAILab team infuses into everything they do. "Not only is the technology we build innovative in its own right," says Maisie Wang, "but without a very stable infrastructure built out, the creativity that all our users display would have nothing to live on!"Going into the specifics of what the Sydney DataAILab team has to offer was Leo Niu, a Site Reliability Engineer. Niu gave a presentation to students about his work and TikTok's goals for the team."On a granular level, we develop and maintain systems to allow users to watch videos and livestreams smoothly and on demand," says Niu. His presentation touched on the creation of TikTok's livestreaming capabilities, and an overview of global video systems, where everything from the ability to upload to content, to pressing play and pause are carefully constructed. "In a broader sense, we provide the best possible user experience."Leo Niu presenting to students at Codefest.He described meeting a group of students working on a project to utilize AI technology to translate Auslan (Australian Sign Language) into English. Coincidentally, the DataAILab team is also working on projects to improve AI translations. This is one of many instances where Codefest gave TikTok teammates a chance to meet prospective early career talent who were passionate about the same things they were."It's very rare for students to have an opportunity to ask employees of a platform they admire in-depth questions about the work," he says. Not only did the work the DataAILab team shared at Codefest interest students, so did TikTok's culture and early career opportunities. "Young people care about their own growth," says Mingfei Hao, another video architecture teammate. "TikTok provides opportunities for them to grow even in an internship or entry-level position. They'll be mentored, and given the freedom to direct and cultivate their own career." "For TikTok, we are always talent-hungry, especially for talents with strong coding skills," says Niu. "Codefest serves a great opportunity for us to connect with early career talent and introduce them to the innovative work we do"Interested in a career on TikTok's DataAILab team?

This summer, TikTok welcomed a new class of interns who brought their unique skills and enthusiasm to a variety of teams and to the platform. Reya, Oliver, and Geoffery, based in Seattle, London, and Sydney respectively, spoke to us about their internships conducting research and implementing cutting-edge technologies, as well as growing and owning their own ideas during their time on their teams.Tell us about the work you do: What does a typical day look like for you?Reya: I'm a machine learning engineer intern, and I work as a part of the Supply Chain and Logistics team in TikTok Shop. A typical day for me is looking at a lot of graphs, analyzing data, coding, fixing bugs, and reading research papers! I really enjoy the freedom we have to explore new ideas and put them into practice. Oliver: I work in Global Business Marketing. I tackle a variety of tasks each day, like creating campaign impact reports, planning agendas, and conducting research. I work on projects such as developing content maps and designing feedback surveys. What I love most is solving problems creatively, whether it's coming up with innovative TikTok merchandise ideas or gathering feedback to shape future projects. My efforts support the team in staying organised and productive.Geoffrey: As a Multimedia Research and Development intern on the Video Cloud Infrastructure team, my typical day at TikTok varies greatly! Some days, I focus solely on development work, while on others, I engage in detailed project discussions and code reviews. During tougher days, I tackle online issues related to streaming. I particularly enjoy the development aspect of my work because designing the infrastructure challenges my critical thinking skills, requiring me to assess whether a design is scalable or if an algorithm is efficient enough.What is the biggest highlight of your work so far? Reya: You know those delivery date ranges you see when you’re shopping? My main project involves improving the accuracy of those predictions, aiming to narrow down the ranges so you don’t have to wait as long for your favorite products. It’s really exciting to work on something where you can directly see your impact on users!Oliver: I worked closely on a project to map out the content for the second half of the year. This involved collaborating with the regional creative lead and consulting with each local market lead. Our goal was to create a new, centralized space where each local market could easily access the content they need and identify the appropriate contacts for further consultation. Once we built it, we started using it within our bi-weekly team meeting!Geoffrey: One of my most exciting projects is streaming cost optimization. TikTok has a very high volume of streaming traffic, which presents a lot of unique challenges to be solved, such as quality of service and streaming costs. My project has personally taught me a lot about streaming infrastructure, API methods, and databases. I received a lot of very helpful feedback from my team members about my code, which improves my code quality and critical thinking. What do you like the most about working at TikTok?Reya: I love that we have a culture that de-empathsizes hierarchy; I can reach out to anyone on the team without worrying about titles or positions. I don’t even know everyone’s titles on my team since they aren’t listed anywhere on their profile. We just focus on what projects everyone is working on, and that’s all that matters. I used to be a bit hesitant about asking questions or reaching out for help when I encounter problems, but at TikTok, my mentor and manager frequently checked in with me to ensure I wasn't facing any issues. This support has made me feel so comfortable that now I don't even think twice before reaching out to anyone.Geoffrey: My favourite part about working at TikTok is the work culture. My mentors always ensure that I am up to date with information, and I always receive constructive feedback on my work, which allows me to improve my skills. We have done several team bonding activities like basketball, dinners, and even board games to strengthen our relationship as people. What advice would you give to someone who is interested in interning at TikTok?Reya: It’s a fast-paced tech environment with incredible people, so having a learning mindset and embracing new, creative ideas is key. Stay updated by reading tech blogs and keeping an eye on the latest trends. Oliver: Show your passion for creativity, no matter what team or department you are in. Go above and beyond in building up a network, cross-functionally. Come into it with a curious mindset. Be open to learning new things. During my internship at TikTok, I learned the importance of adaptability, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement.Geoffrey: Go for it! TikTok is a great opportunity to learn from industry professionals, and get guidance and feedback from your mentor. There will be many new, interesting things to learn, and many invaluable opportunities to grow your skillset and connections. Working at TikTok has not only helped me develop fundamental skills in code development and practices, but has also given me deep insight into the software industry. As a software engineer, I understand a lot more about how business decisions are made, and how they affect clients/users. Across teams, TikTok interns get the chance to learn, grow, and cultivate inspiration that's infinite. Interested in applying for the next internship season? Don't hesitate!

At TikTok, we're dedicated to discovering and nurturing early career talents. One of the ways we do this is by going straight to the source: students completing their higher education and beginning to define their professional goals. That's why this July, we worked with the University of Sydney in Australia to sponsor Codefest. Codefest is an annual coding competition where students from the school's graduate program come together to sharpen their skills, as well as connect with peers and hear presentations from industry leaders in the fields of technology, Research &amp; Development, and AI. Members of TikTok's DataAILab team attended Codefest to talk about creativity in coding, how their work impacts every aspect of TikTok's platform, and what they're looking for in Early Career hires. "Codefest sets a stage for university students to tackle real-world problems, ranging from finding a parking spot to translating sign languages," says Maisie Wang, a human resources partner on the team. She helped run a booth at Codefest and connected with attendees to chat about day-to-day life at TikTok. "Codefest bridges the gap between academy and industry. The students get to think about how to convert the knowledge and skills they learn at school to innovative solutions that contribute to our community. "Employees that work on DataAILab are responsible for developing and maintaining the series of infrastructure systems that make TikTok work. These include the product recommendation algorithms, large language models, and the transcoding and decoding involved in streaming and uploading. We are also responsible for Risk Engineering &amp; Research, Big Data R&amp;D, and Open Platform technology." The team hiring in the Sydney office has a particular focus on video architecture. This work is what brought together TikTok with the University of Sydney. Professor Zhiyong Wang, who teaches computer science at the school, connected with TikTok to discuss the theme of 2024 Codefest; "Creativity in Coding". Professor Wang invited TikTok to participate in the event, because creativity is something the DataAILab team infuses into everything they do. "Not only is the technology we build innovative in its own right," says Maisie Wang, "but without a very stable infrastructure built out, the creativity that all our users display would have nothing to live on!"Going into the specifics of what the Sydney DataAILab team has to offer was Leo Niu, a Site Reliability Engineer. Niu gave a presentation to students about his work and TikTok's goals for the team."On a granular level, we develop and maintain systems to allow users to watch videos and livestreams smoothly and on demand," says Niu. His presentation touched on the creation of TikTok's livestreaming capabilities, and an overview of global video systems, where everything from the ability to upload to content, to pressing play and pause are carefully constructed. "In a broader sense, we provide the best possible user experience."Leo Niu presenting to students at Codefest.He described meeting a group of students working on a project to utilize AI technology to translate Auslan (Australian Sign Language) into English. Coincidentally, the DataAILab team is also working on projects to improve AI translations. This is one of many instances where Codefest gave TikTok teammates a chance to meet prospective early career talent who were passionate about the same things they were."It's very rare for students to have an opportunity to ask employees of a platform they admire in-depth questions about the work," he says. Not only did the work the DataAILab team shared at Codefest interest students, so did TikTok's culture and early career opportunities. "Young people care about their own growth," says Mingfei Hao, another video architecture teammate. "TikTok provides opportunities for them to grow even in an internship or entry-level position. They'll be mentored, and given the freedom to direct and cultivate their own career." "For TikTok, we are always talent-hungry, especially for talents with strong coding skills," says Niu. "Codefest serves a great opportunity for us to connect with early career talent and introduce them to the innovative work we do"Interested in a career on TikTok's DataAILab team?

Small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) are the backbone of commerce at Tiktok. According to Oxford Economics, TikTok SMBs generate thousands of jobs for sellers globally, and contributed $24.2 billion to the US economy in 2023. For the people who make up the SMB team, supporting these businesses through building relationships, and equipping clients with the tools needed to succeed, is one of the highlights of the job. We spoke to Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine about what it takes to keep businesses thriving and users satisfied. "Being an SMB Account Manager at TikTok is all about client relationships," says Fabio Arendt, who is based in the Hamburg office. "We’re the go-to people for anything our clients need, whether it’s solving last-minute challenges or perfecting their campaign strategies. It's more than just troubleshooting a technical issue. We help these businesses reach customers and generate awareness of their brands, products, and services. Businesses all over the world depend on TikTok’s unique ability to help them reach otherwise unreachable customers."While Arendt manages established accounts, Justine Abdallah helps start new ones off on the right foot. With a concentration on brand strategy, her work includes providing new businesses with material resources to help spark creativity and begin building their campaigns on TikTok. "On the acquisition team, you're the first face a new customer or a new client sees when onboarding," she says. "So we want them to be fully equipped from Day 1."Lorenzo Bierhuys helps SMBs liaise with agencies that are also working with clients to develop eye-catching business campaigns for the platform. "What I really like about this job is that you get to work with colleagues who have specialized market knowledge,” Bierhuys says, noting his team is responsible for locations across Europe, including France, Italy and Spain. "It’s great being able to work together with, and learn from people working across different geographies.""We put everything in place to ensure they're successful on TikTok and empowered to unlock more of their full potential," adds Natalie Rois, who work on the team in Dublin. One of the team's projects to support that goal involved regional growth in Europe and the Middle East. Abdallah and coworkers helped organize an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to pitch campaign ideas to customers. "Helping small and medium businesses grow is so rewarding, because you get to watch them blossom," says Abdallah. "Sometimes we have a client with zero idea what advertising on TikTok looks like, zero idea how it's going to work. So you get to be with them every step of the way, and see them become success stories." While helping businesses succeed online drove all four of them to join the team, the culture of TikTok is why Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine have all stayed. "We're constantly learning from each other," says Arendt. "It’s funny how, by simply listening with intent, I end up learning far more than I would by relying on the knowledge I already have. Add to that the international environment we thrive in, where diverse viewpoints are celebrated, and it’s a recipe for empathy and understanding. Every conversation sharpens my ability to truly see things from others’ perspectives, making me more attuned to each client’s unique needs."The team doesn't only support clients and businesses; it supports the people who make TikTok what it is. Arendt went on to describe a particularly empowering and supportive working culture, especially when he transferred from the Dublin office to Hamburg. "When the company planted its flag in Central Europe with a shiny new satellite office in Hamburg, I found myself toying with the idea of heading back home to Germany. Before I let the daydreams of the Baltic Sea take over, I had a heart-to-heart with my line manager about the potential move, my career goals, and, of course, my personal growth. Her response? Total support from start to finish. Fast forward a bit, and voilà—I traded Dublin's rain for Hamburg's!""What stands out a lot if you compare scaling your projects at TikTok to a similar company," says Bierhuys. “Cross-functional collaboration is definitely encouraged. If there’s value my team can add, we get a lot of freedom to get involved in co-owned projects and we’ve definitely made a positive impact to the organization through these partnerships.""You'll never be bored," says Abdallah. "Every day there's a new feature to try out, or a new client, or a new campaign." She mentions one of the company's core values, Always Day 1, which means maintaining an entrepreneurial and enthusiastic mindset, no matter how long you've been with the company. "We adapt and test constantly, and when something isn't working, we work as a team to find a solution." Rois agrees. “We have a serious test and learn culture here. We try, identify errors and fix processes as we progress. There’s so much room for developing and implementing new practices here.”Interested in joining a team that has a front-row seat to e-commerce innovation and growth?

Since then, I've held a variety of roles focusing on trust and safety policy in the United States, and today I'm the Global Head of Regional Product Policy. From the start, my work involved rationalizing the safety policy framework and thinking through what our safety principles were, so that we could develop the safety policies needed to create a joyful experience on TikTok.I came to TikTok from the NYU Stern School of Business, where I worked for the Center for Business and Human Rights. We looked at how we could leverage corporate commitments to advance human rights in a range of different sectors, from fast fashion to labor, and all the ways you can help people at scale. If you have an ambassador to Denmark, but not an ambassador to Walmart on matters of fast fashion, then are you really looking to solve the problem in the right way with all the resources available to you? Then, I pivoted to the technology sector, where the traditional concerns were data privacy and freedom of expression. As I dove into it, I saw that there were a whole host of issues that policies hadn't really been created for yet. For example, what does hate speech and the evolution of hate speech really look like on social media platforms? What do conversations about mental health and body image look like? What are we doing to protect minors from things that they could be so easily exposed to on the internet, that they're not really developmentally ready for?Joining TikTok, I was excited by the opportunity to see what a new global platform could do when it comes to being safety-first in tech. The way that everyone from CEO Shou Chew on down works to make sure people on the platform feel like they belong and can connect to the people that are most impactful to them. The diversity of content that we see on the platform is one of our strengths; you can find anything and relate to people globally. The platform has grown so much from what it originally was. With the addition of livestreaming and monetization, we've had a really wonderful opportunity to build new policies to help protect people in every aspect of the platform.A lot of the policies we've put in place that I'm most proud of answer the question, "how do we manage safety concerns and building a place where people can authentically be themselves?" We want people to talk about challenges that they've overcome, and what their life experience has been, but also be mindful at when that crosses the line into glorification and promotion. For example, any ads that promote weight management products cannot promote a negative body image or negative relationship with food. We partnered with the National Eating Disorder Association to connect people with resources to help anyone who may be struggling with body image issues if they interact with harmful content.The power of the community has always been so strong on TikTok, and we want it to be a place where people can be met on their level. The content for those under eighteen will be different than that for adults, to give another example. Educational content is really great, but sometimes only relevant or appropriate for adults. So content classification becomes really important there, and people who are younger and still on their developmental journey aren't exposed to content that might not be appropriate for them. What I've loved about working on policy here has been that we don't have a one-size-fits-all policy framework that we export across all the markets that we serve. Everything is tailored to the relevant needs of different groups and locations. Above all, working on policy at TikTok is a really rewarding way to feel like I am making an impact globally. When you come from a human rights background like I do, you always wanna make sure that you're doing good. This job has really given me that opportunity.If you're interested in a career shaping policy and creating the best possible experience for the TikTok community, explore open roles now.  2024-10-09 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7423838003830130981)

As a global team, GSO has offices in places like New York, Washington DC, Dublin, San Jose, and Singapore. The team focuses on issues like cybersecurity, data protection, incident response, and certifying compliance with global regulations wherever TikTok operates.Another major role that GSO plays is to constantly monitor TikTok's apps, systems, and APIs to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by bad actors and potentially harm TikTok or our community. The team in charge, known as Vulnerability Management (VM), receives reports on these potential issues from a variety of sources, triages the findings, and then works with the appropriate product teams to remediate them as quickly as possible in order to keep our community safe. Suhana Hyder, who leads the team, explains their work simply, "I always feel like we're superheroes. We're trying to find issues and get them fixed before they can impact the platform or our users. It's a very exciting feeling." TikTok's own security superheroes receive vulnerability reports from a variety of sources, like internal and external penetration testing teams. For the past four years, they have also worked with HackerOne, a trusted partner company that provides security researchers or ethical hackers with a platform to report vulnerabilities to companies like TikTok. These researchers receive bounties for valid "bug" they find in our system.In late July and early August of 2024, the VM team held a Live Hacking Event through HackerOne, following up on a similar effort last year as part of the Ambassador World Cup. During this two week event, TikTok's bug bounties were increased, the scope of work was narrowed, and 50 of the world's top ethical hackers from 29 countries probed our systems to help us find and patch vulnerabilities. Of over 300 reports that were submitted, more than 100 were valid vulnerabilities,and we awarded a total of $721,695 in bounties to the researchers who helped us keep the TikTok platform safe. Zhaohong Liu from the VM team described the live hacking event, "This was such a great activity. We were very happy to engage with these top level hackers in person. We saw so many high-quality reports, even more so than we see in our main bug bounty program. We also received a lot of valuable support and collaboration from crossfunctional teams to make this event possible." Due to the increased volume in reports and the shortened timeline, VM worked with other internal teams like TikTok Security Assurance, Singapore Security Assurance, and the Global Security Organization's Attack Surface Management team, which triaged about 50% of the reports that came in during the live hacking event.Highlighting the crossfunctional collaboration, Suhana Hyder said, "We could not have done this without them. This live hacking event yielded so many valid reports, and that level of triaging required us to be available 24 hours a day, five days a week. Security is a team sport, and we're grateful for the collaboration."The vulnerabilities found and patched through this effort help to protect not only the TikTok platform, but also its global community. Singapore technical team lead Ethan Liu put it plainly, "Knowing that we patched another loophole, another vulnerability that could have impacted our platform is the most rewarding part of our job. I love knowing that we fix problems before bad actors can use them to hack our systems. I love knowing that we're contributing not only to the company, but also to the entire TikTok community. The work we do is keeping them safe."If you're interested in helping to keep the TikTok platform and its community secure, explore the open roles in security today.  2024-10-08 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7423443679719016714)

Small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) are the backbone of commerce at Tiktok. According to Oxford Economics, TikTok SMBs generate thousands of jobs for sellers globally, and contributed $24.2 billion to the US economy in 2023. For the people who make up the SMB team, supporting these businesses through building relationships, and equipping clients with the tools needed to succeed, is one of the highlights of the job. We spoke to Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine about what it takes to keep businesses thriving and users satisfied. "Being an SMB Account Manager at TikTok is all about client relationships," says Fabio Arendt, who is based in the Hamburg office. "We’re the go-to people for anything our clients need, whether it’s solving last-minute challenges or perfecting their campaign strategies. It's more than just troubleshooting a technical issue. We help these businesses reach customers and generate awareness of their brands, products, and services. Businesses all over the world depend on TikTok’s unique ability to help them reach otherwise unreachable customers."While Arendt manages established accounts, Justine Abdallah helps start new ones off on the right foot. With a concentration on brand strategy, her work includes providing new businesses with material resources to help spark creativity and begin building their campaigns on TikTok. "On the acquisition team, you're the first face a new customer or a new client sees when onboarding," she says. "So we want them to be fully equipped from Day 1."Lorenzo Bierhuys helps SMBs liaise with agencies that are also working with clients to develop eye-catching business campaigns for the platform. "What I really like about this job is that you get to work with colleagues who have specialized market knowledge,” Bierhuys says, noting his team is responsible for locations across Europe, including France, Italy and Spain. "It’s great being able to work together with, and learn from people working across different geographies.""We put everything in place to ensure they're successful on TikTok and empowered to unlock more of their full potential," adds Natalie Rois, who work on the team in Dublin. One of the team's projects to support that goal involved regional growth in Europe and the Middle East. Abdallah and coworkers helped organize an event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to pitch campaign ideas to customers. "Helping small and medium businesses grow is so rewarding, because you get to watch them blossom," says Abdallah. "Sometimes we have a client with zero idea what advertising on TikTok looks like, zero idea how it's going to work. So you get to be with them every step of the way, and see them become success stories." While helping businesses succeed online drove all four of them to join the team, the culture of TikTok is why Natalie, Fabio, Lorenzo, and Justine have all stayed. "We're constantly learning from each other," says Arendt. "It’s funny how, by simply listening with intent, I end up learning far more than I would by relying on the knowledge I already have. Add to that the international environment we thrive in, where diverse viewpoints are celebrated, and it’s a recipe for empathy and understanding. Every conversation sharpens my ability to truly see things from others’ perspectives, making me more attuned to each client’s unique needs."The team doesn't only support clients and businesses; it supports the people who make TikTok what it is. Arendt went on to describe a particularly empowering and supportive working culture, especially when he transferred from the Dublin office to Hamburg. "When the company planted its flag in Central Europe with a shiny new satellite office in Hamburg, I found myself toying with the idea of heading back home to Germany. Before I let the daydreams of the Baltic Sea take over, I had a heart-to-heart with my line manager about the potential move, my career goals, and, of course, my personal growth. Her response? Total support from start to finish. Fast forward a bit, and voilà—I traded Dublin's rain for Hamburg's!""What stands out a lot if you compare scaling your projects at TikTok to a similar company," says Bierhuys. “Cross-functional collaboration is definitely encouraged. If there’s value my team can add, we get a lot of freedom to get involved in co-owned projects and we’ve definitely made a positive impact to the organization through these partnerships.""You'll never be bored," says Abdallah. "Every day there's a new feature to try out, or a new client, or a new campaign." She mentions one of the company's core values, Always Day 1, which means maintaining an entrepreneurial and enthusiastic mindset, no matter how long you've been with the company. "We adapt and test constantly, and when something isn't working, we work as a team to find a solution." Rois agrees. “We have a serious test and learn culture here. We try, identify errors and fix processes as we progress. There’s so much room for developing and implementing new practices here.”Interested in joining a team that has a front-row seat to e-commerce innovation and growth?

Since then, I've held a variety of roles focusing on trust and safety policy in the United States, and today I'm the Global Head of Regional Product Policy. From the start, my work involved rationalizing the safety policy framework and thinking through what our safety principles were, so that we could develop the safety policies needed to create a joyful experience on TikTok.I came to TikTok from the NYU Stern School of Business, where I worked for the Center for Business and Human Rights. We looked at how we could leverage corporate commitments to advance human rights in a range of different sectors, from fast fashion to labor, and all the ways you can help people at scale. If you have an ambassador to Denmark, but not an ambassador to Walmart on matters of fast fashion, then are you really looking to solve the problem in the right way with all the resources available to you? Then, I pivoted to the technology sector, where the traditional concerns were data privacy and freedom of expression. As I dove into it, I saw that there were a whole host of issues that policies hadn't really been created for yet. For example, what does hate speech and the evolution of hate speech really look like on social media platforms? What do conversations about mental health and body image look like? What are we doing to protect minors from things that they could be so easily exposed to on the internet, that they're not really developmentally ready for?Joining TikTok, I was excited by the opportunity to see what a new global platform could do when it comes to being safety-first in tech. The way that everyone from CEO Shou Chew on down works to make sure people on the platform feel like they belong and can connect to the people that are most impactful to them. The diversity of content that we see on the platform is one of our strengths; you can find anything and relate to people globally. The platform has grown so much from what it originally was. With the addition of livestreaming and monetization, we've had a really wonderful opportunity to build new policies to help protect people in every aspect of the platform.A lot of the policies we've put in place that I'm most proud of answer the question, "how do we manage safety concerns and building a place where people can authentically be themselves?" We want people to talk about challenges that they've overcome, and what their life experience has been, but also be mindful at when that crosses the line into glorification and promotion. For example, any ads that promote weight management products cannot promote a negative body image or negative relationship with food. We partnered with the National Eating Disorder Association to connect people with resources to help anyone who may be struggling with body image issues if they interact with harmful content.The power of the community has always been so strong on TikTok, and we want it to be a place where people can be met on their level. The content for those under eighteen will be different than that for adults, to give another example. Educational content is really great, but sometimes only relevant or appropriate for adults. So content classification becomes really important there, and people who are younger and still on their developmental journey aren't exposed to content that might not be appropriate for them. What I've loved about working on policy here has been that we don't have a one-size-fits-all policy framework that we export across all the markets that we serve. Everything is tailored to the relevant needs of different groups and locations. Above all, working on policy at TikTok is a really rewarding way to feel like I am making an impact globally. When you come from a human rights background like I do, you always wanna make sure that you're doing good. This job has really given me that opportunity.If you're interested in a career shaping policy and creating the best possible experience for the TikTok community, explore open roles now.  2024-10-09 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7423838003830130981)

As a global team, GSO has offices in places like New York, Washington DC, Dublin, San Jose, and Singapore. The team focuses on issues like cybersecurity, data protection, incident response, and certifying compliance with global regulations wherever TikTok operates.Another major role that GSO plays is to constantly monitor TikTok's apps, systems, and APIs to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by bad actors and potentially harm TikTok or our community. The team in charge, known as Vulnerability Management (VM), receives reports on these potential issues from a variety of sources, triages the findings, and then works with the appropriate product teams to remediate them as quickly as possible in order to keep our community safe. Suhana Hyder, who leads the team, explains their work simply, "I always feel like we're superheroes. We're trying to find issues and get them fixed before they can impact the platform or our users. It's a very exciting feeling." TikTok's own security superheroes receive vulnerability reports from a variety of sources, like internal and external penetration testing teams. For the past four years, they have also worked with HackerOne, a trusted partner company that provides security researchers or ethical hackers with a platform to report vulnerabilities to companies like TikTok. These researchers receive bounties for valid "bug" they find in our system.In late July and early August of 2024, the VM team held a Live Hacking Event through HackerOne, following up on a similar effort last year as part of the Ambassador World Cup. During this two week event, TikTok's bug bounties were increased, the scope of work was narrowed, and 50 of the world's top ethical hackers from 29 countries probed our systems to help us find and patch vulnerabilities. Of over 300 reports that were submitted, more than 100 were valid vulnerabilities,and we awarded a total of $721,695 in bounties to the researchers who helped us keep the TikTok platform safe. Zhaohong Liu from the VM team described the live hacking event, "This was such a great activity. We were very happy to engage with these top level hackers in person. We saw so many high-quality reports, even more so than we see in our main bug bounty program. We also received a lot of valuable support and collaboration from crossfunctional teams to make this event possible." Due to the increased volume in reports and the shortened timeline, VM worked with other internal teams like TikTok Security Assurance, Singapore Security Assurance, and the Global Security Organization's Attack Surface Management team, which triaged about 50% of the reports that came in during the live hacking event.Highlighting the crossfunctional collaboration, Suhana Hyder said, "We could not have done this without them. This live hacking event yielded so many valid reports, and that level of triaging required us to be available 24 hours a day, five days a week. Security is a team sport, and we're grateful for the collaboration."The vulnerabilities found and patched through this effort help to protect not only the TikTok platform, but also its global community. Singapore technical team lead Ethan Liu put it plainly, "Knowing that we patched another loophole, another vulnerability that could have impacted our platform is the most rewarding part of our job. I love knowing that we fix problems before bad actors can use them to hack our systems. I love knowing that we're contributing not only to the company, but also to the entire TikTok community. The work we do is keeping them safe."If you're interested in helping to keep the TikTok platform and its community secure, explore the open roles in security today.  2024-10-08 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7423443679719016714)

This summer, TikTok welcomed a new class of interns who brought their unique skills and enthusiasm to a variety of teams and to the platform. Reya, Oliver, and Geoffery, based in Seattle, London, and Sydney respectively, spoke to us about their internships conducting research and implementing cutting-edge technologies, as well as growing and owning their own ideas during their time on their teams.Tell us about the work you do: What does a typical day look like for you?Reya: I'm a machine learning engineer intern, and I work as a part of the Supply Chain and Logistics team in TikTok Shop. A typical day for me is looking at a lot of graphs, analyzing data, coding, fixing bugs, and reading research papers! I really enjoy the freedom we have to explore new ideas and put them into practice. Oliver: I work in Global Business Marketing. I tackle a variety of tasks each day, like creating campaign impact reports, planning agendas, and conducting research. I work on projects such as developing content maps and designing feedback surveys. What I love most is solving problems creatively, whether it's coming up with innovative TikTok merchandise ideas or gathering feedback to shape future projects. My efforts support the team in staying organised and productive.Geoffrey: As a Multimedia Research and Development intern on the Video Cloud Infrastructure team, my typical day at TikTok varies greatly! Some days, I focus solely on development work, while on others, I engage in detailed project discussions and code reviews. During tougher days, I tackle online issues related to streaming. I particularly enjoy the development aspect of my work because designing the infrastructure challenges my critical thinking skills, requiring me to assess whether a design is scalable or if an algorithm is efficient enough.What is the biggest highlight of your work so far? Reya: You know those delivery date ranges you see when you’re shopping? My main project involves improving the accuracy of those predictions, aiming to narrow down the ranges so you don’t have to wait as long for your favorite products. It’s really exciting to work on something where you can directly see your impact on users!Oliver: I worked closely on a project to map out the content for the second half of the year. This involved collaborating with the regional creative lead and consulting with each local market lead. Our goal was to create a new, centralized space where each local market could easily access the content they need and identify the appropriate contacts for further consultation. Once we built it, we started using it within our bi-weekly team meeting!Geoffrey: One of my most exciting projects is streaming cost optimization. TikTok has a very high volume of streaming traffic, which presents a lot of unique challenges to be solved, such as quality of service and streaming costs. My project has personally taught me a lot about streaming infrastructure, API methods, and databases. I received a lot of very helpful feedback from my team members about my code, which improves my code quality and critical thinking. What do you like the most about working at TikTok?Reya: I love that we have a culture that de-empathsizes hierarchy; I can reach out to anyone on the team without worrying about titles or positions. I don’t even know everyone’s titles on my team since they aren’t listed anywhere on their profile. We just focus on what projects everyone is working on, and that’s all that matters. I used to be a bit hesitant about asking questions or reaching out for help when I encounter problems, but at TikTok, my mentor and manager frequently checked in with me to ensure I wasn't facing any issues. This support has made me feel so comfortable that now I don't even think twice before reaching out to anyone.Geoffrey: My favourite part about working at TikTok is the work culture. My mentors always ensure that I am up to date with information, and I always receive constructive feedback on my work, which allows me to improve my skills. We have done several team bonding activities like basketball, dinners, and even board games to strengthen our relationship as people. What advice would you give to someone who is interested in interning at TikTok?Reya: It’s a fast-paced tech environment with incredible people, so having a learning mindset and embracing new, creative ideas is key. Stay updated by reading tech blogs and keeping an eye on the latest trends. Oliver: Show your passion for creativity, no matter what team or department you are in. Go above and beyond in building up a network, cross-functionally. Come into it with a curious mindset. Be open to learning new things. During my internship at TikTok, I learned the importance of adaptability, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement.Geoffrey: Go for it! TikTok is a great opportunity to learn from industry professionals, and get guidance and feedback from your mentor. There will be many new, interesting things to learn, and many invaluable opportunities to grow your skillset and connections. Working at TikTok has not only helped me develop fundamental skills in code development and practices, but has also given me deep insight into the software industry. As a software engineer, I understand a lot more about how business decisions are made, and how they affect clients/users. Across teams, TikTok interns get the chance to learn, grow, and cultivate inspiration that's infinite. Interested in applying for the next internship season? Don't hesitate! Submit your application now and take the first step towards an enriching internship experience.  2024-09-27 ](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog/detail/7419010360248109363)

At TikTok, we're dedicated to discovering and nurturing early career talents. One of the ways we do this is by going straight to the source: students completing their higher education and beginning to define their professional goals. That's why this July, we worked with the University of Sydney in Australia to sponsor Codefest. Codefest is an annual coding competition where students from the school's graduate program come together to sharpen their skills, as well as connect with peers and hear presentations from industry leaders in the fields of technology, Research &amp; Development, and AI. Members of TikTok's DataAILab team attended Codefest to talk about creativity in coding, how their work impacts every aspect of TikTok's platform, and what they're looking for in Early Career hires. "Codefest sets a stage for university students to tackle real-world problems, ranging from finding a parking spot to translating sign languages," says Maisie Wang, a human resources partner on the team. She helped run a booth at Codefest and connected with attendees to chat about day-to-day life at TikTok. "Codefest bridges the gap between academy and industry. The students get to think about how to convert the knowledge and skills they learn at school to innovative solutions that contribute to our community. "Employees that work on DataAILab are responsible for developing and maintaining the series of infrastructure systems that make TikTok work. These include the product recommendation algorithms, large language models, and the transcoding and decoding involved in streaming and uploading. We are also responsible for Risk Engineering &amp; Research, Big Data R&amp;D, and Open Platform technology." The team hiring in the Sydney office has a particular focus on video architecture. This work is what brought together TikTok with the University of Sydney. Professor Zhiyong Wang, who teaches computer science at the school, connected with TikTok to discuss the theme of 2024 Codefest; "Creativity in Coding". Professor Wang invited TikTok to participate in the event, because creativity is something the DataAILab team infuses into everything they do. "Not only is the technology we build innovative in its own right," says Maisie Wang, "but without a very stable infrastructure built out, the creativity that all our users display would have nothing to live on!"Going into the specifics of what the Sydney DataAILab team has to offer was Leo Niu, a Site Reliability Engineer. Niu gave a presentation to students about his work and TikTok's goals for the team."On a granular level, we develop and maintain systems to allow users to watch videos and livestreams smoothly and on demand," says Niu. His presentation touched on the creation of TikTok's livestreaming capabilities, and an overview of global video systems, where everything from the ability to upload to content, to pressing play and pause are carefully constructed. "In a broader sense, we provide the best possible user experience."Leo Niu presenting to students at Codefest.He described meeting a group of students working on a project to utilize AI technology to translate Auslan (Australian Sign Language) into English.

##  InfiniEdge AI 1.1: Pushing the Boundaries of Real-Time Edge Intelligence
_InfiniEdge AI_ ,**1.1** , bringing a wave of upgrades that make on-device AI faster, more integrated, and easier to use than ever. InfiniEdge AI’s mission is to simplify the deployment of efficient, low-latency AI models on resource-constrained devices, and this update delivers on that promise with significant performance optimizations, seamless new integrations, and even a TikTok Live demo showcasing its capabilities. In this post, we’ll explore what’s new in InfiniEdge AI 1.1 and how it empowers developers to build smarter, real-time edge applications.
## Key nighlights in InfiniEdge AI 1.1
  * **Enhanced Performance:** Optimizations to the core inference engine and edge runtime yield lower latency and higher throughput for AI models running on devices. Even on resource-constrained hardware, neural networks execute faster and more efficiently than before.
  * **SPEAR & OPEA Integration:** InfiniEdge 1.1 now tightly integrates with the **SPEAR** distributed agent framework and the **OPEA** enterprise AI platform. This creates a unified edge-to-cloud pipeline, allowing one-click deployment and orchestration of AI workflows that span from edge devices to the cloud.
  * **Real-Time AI Demo (TikTok Live):** A new case study shows InfiniEdge AI powering an interactive agent in a TikTok Live Studio stream. The AI agent can listen to live voice commands and respond instantly on-stream – all processed locally at the edge in real time.
  * **No-Code Agent Development:** InfiniEdge 1.1 connects with a no-code AI development platform, enabling developers (and even non-programmers) to build and deploy AI agents without writing code. This opens the door to multi-agent systems and custom AI experiences running at the edge with minimal effort.
## Enhanced edge performance and efficiency
One of the biggest improvements in InfiniEdge 1.1 is its **speed and efficiency** in running AI on edge devices. The underlying AI inference engine has been finely tuned to reduce processing latency and squeeze more throughput out of the same hardware. An upgraded multi-core execution engine and smarter scheduling mean that even complex neural networks run **swiftly on resource-constrained devices**. For example, the data pipeline now uses zero-copy serialization (adopting FlatBuffers) instead of heavier protocols—an update that significantly cuts overhead. In practical terms, edge applications like video analytics or sensor processing can respond in real time with lower CPU usage and less heat, important for battery-powered or embedded scenarios.
These performance optimizations bring _cloud-like_ AI capability to local devices. Developers can deploy more demanding models at the edge and trust that InfiniEdge will handle them reliably and efficiently. The end result is an AI platform that can tackle intensive workloads on-site with improved stability and speed. Whether it’s a smart camera doing instant object detection or an AR filter responding to user movements, InfiniEdge 1.1 ensures on-device AI is up to the task.
## Unified edge-to-cloud pipeline with SPEAR & OPEA
Release 1.1 makes it far easier to build **hybrid AI solutions** that leverage both edge and cloud resources. The InfiniEdge AI architecture now integrates deeply with two key projects: **SPEAR** and **OPEA**. SPEAR is an InfiniEdge workstream focused on scalable, distributed AI agents, while OPEA (Open Platform for Enterprise AI) provides enterprise-grade AI building blocks and model management tools. In 1.1, these are woven directly into InfiniEdge’s workflow.
What does this mean for developers? In short, you can design a complex AI workflow that spans from edge nodes to cloud servers _and deploy it with a single command or click_. InfiniEdge AI uses SPEAR to orchestrate AI agents across distributed edge nodes (think of many devices collaborating), and uses OPEA on the cloud side to manage models, versions, and data. The whole process works seamlessly: an AI model might be trained or updated in the cloud, then InfiniEdge can automatically distribute that updated model out to all the edge devices running it. Likewise, data or insights collected at the edge can flow back to cloud analytics effortlessly. InfiniEdge 1.1 essentially **erases the friction** in edge-cloud synergy—you get a cohesive pipeline where intelligence moves to where it’s needed, without manual integration headaches.
For example, imagine you’re rolling out an AI-driven video moderation system. With InfiniEdge 1.1, you could use OPEA to update your moderation model in the cloud, and SPEAR to push that update to hundreds of cameras running InfiniEdge at the edge—all in one go. The edge devices handle inference locally (flagging inappropriate content in real time), while the cloud collects summary data to further refine the model. Thanks to the new unified pipeline, such a setup is much simpler to implement. **Edge-to-cloud deployment** is now clearer and more streamlined, letting developers focus on building features rather than managing distribution logistics.
## Real-time AI in action with TikTok Live Studio
Nothing demonstrates InfiniEdge AI’s advancements better than seeing it in action. In Release 1.1, one of the most exciting demos involved **TikTok Live Studio** as a testing ground for real-time edge AI. In collaboration with TikTok’s Live engineering team, the InfiniEdge project deployed an interactive AI agent during a live streaming session—with impressive results.
**Here’s what happened:** During a TikTok Live stream, an AI agent powered by InfiniEdge AI was set up to listen to voice commands from the host and viewers. For instance, a viewer might say _“Show me comments from new users”_ —and the agent would instantly carry out that action on the live stream. Because InfiniEdge executes AI inference locally (right in the Live Studio environment), the agent could understand the command and respond **instantaneously** , without needing to send data to a distant server. The low-latency processing is crucial in a live scenario—any delay would be noticeable on stream. With InfiniEdge 1.1 running at the edge, the voice command was processed on-the-fly and the result was seen in the stream in real time, demonstrating true interactive AI.
Behind the scenes, this demo used InfiniEdge’s SPEAR framework to run the agent on an edge node (the Live host’s device or local studio server), while the OPEA integration managed the AI models involved (like the speech recognition and natural language understanding models). The outcome was a **smooth, engaging live experience** where audience input was handled on-the-spot by AI. This TikTok Live example highlights InfiniEdge AI’s ability to deal with streaming data and user interactions with ultra-low latency. It opens up new possibilities for developers: think live content moderation bots that work instantly on your device, real-time translation or captioning for streams, AR effects that respond to voice or gestures in live video, or interactive live assistants that make streams more engaging. All of this can be built on an edge infrastructure that keeps data local (for privacy) and response times **split-second fast**.
## No-code AI agent development
Another exciting aspect of InfiniEdge AI 1.1 is how it **lowers the barrier** to creating AI-driven applications. This release integrates with a next-generation AI application platform that offers a **no-code** environment for building AI agents and chatbots. It allows users to design AI logic through an intuitive interface—configuring an agent’s knowledge base, memory, and multi-step workflows—all without writing any code. Now, with InfiniEdge 1.1, those no-code agents can be deployed and run at the edge effortlessly.
For developers, this means you can prototype and deploy intelligent agents faster than ever. Even if you’re not an AI expert or a programmer, it provides tools to create a personalized AI assistant or workflow. InfiniEdge AI then acts as the powerful runtime that executes these agents on edge hardware (and even coordinates multiple agents across devices). This combination unlocks some potent capabilities. You could have **multiple agents working together** via InfiniEdge—for example, one agent analyzing camera feeds and another agent handling user queries—collaborating to accomplish a complex task in an IoT environment. Or consider a scenario like a smart home: using its GUI, a developer (or technically savvy end-user) could set up a custom home assistant agent with specific routines and knowledge, then deploy it to a home hub running InfiniEdge. The agent would run locally on the device, benefiting from InfiniEdge’s low-latency inference and offline reliability.
By embracing no-code approach, InfiniEdge AI 1.1 makes AI agent development far more **accessible** while still leveraging a high-performance edge infrastructure. It bridges the gap between easy creation and powerful deployment. You can quickly bring an AI idea to life, then let InfiniEdge handle the heavy lifting of running it optimally on real-world edge devices. This synergy accelerates experimentation and iteration of AI solutions—from prototype to production in a frictionless workflow.
## Looking ahead: Get involved with InfiniEdge AI
InfiniEdge AI 1.1 marks a significant step forward in open-source edge intelligence. Its performance and integration enhancements not only improve what’s possible today, but also lay the groundwork for future innovations (imagine federated learning across edge devices, broader hardware acceleration support, and more). As an **LF Edge** project under the Linux Foundation, InfiniEdge AI thrives on community collaboration. We invite developers, data scientists, and edge enthusiasts to be a part of this journey and help shape what comes next.

At FOSDEM 2025, Dayeol Lee, a Research Scientist at TikTok's Privacy Innovation Lab, introduced ManaTEE, an open-source framework designed to facilitate privacy-preserving data analytics for public research. The framework integrates Privacy-Enhancing Techniques (PETs), including confidential computing, to safeguard data privacy without compromising usability. It offers an interactive interface through JupyterLab, providing an intuitive experience for researchers and data scientists. ManaTEE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to ensure both data confidentiality and execution integrity, fostering trust between data owners and analysts. Additionally, it provides proof of execution through attestation, enabling researchers to demonstrate the reproducibility and integrity of their results. The framework simplifies deployment by leveraging cloud-based confidential computing backends, making secure and private data analytics accessible and scalable for diverse use cases.
The video recording of Dayeol Lee's presentation is available for viewing:
ManaTEE was originally developed by TikTok as a privacy solution for secure data collaboration and has been donated to the Linux Foundation's Confidential Computing Consortium. Also, ManaTEE is the core privacy preserving technology powering TikTok Research Tools, such as the TikTok [Virtual Compute Environment (VCE)](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/vce-getting-started). The framework is designed to meet the increasing need for secure data collaboration, addressing critical challenges in data privacy and security.
# Private data for public interest
Private data is considered very valuable for businesses, as they can extract significant value from it. However, many miss the value of private data for public interest. Personal or proprietary data can be combined to provide insights into various public research domains such as public health, public safety, and education. For example, medical data could be combined with personal dietary data to offer insights into how personal habits impact health.
Data analytics for public interest often requires the combination of numerous datasets to ensure accurate insights and conclusions. Sometimes these datasets come from different sources. There are several challenges to fully combining these datasets. Multiple data providers may have conflicting interests and enforce different privacy policies and compliances. Moreover, data may be distributed across many platforms, including on-premise clusters, clouds, and data warehouses, making it hard to ensure all computations on the data are accountable and transparent.
# What is ManaTEE?
To fully enable privacy-preserving data analytics for public interest, we need a standardized approach that provides strong privacy protection with technical enforcement, as well as accountability and transparency. Moreover, we need a framework that is easy to deploy and use.
We find that existing technical solutions such as differential privacy and trusted execution environments offer great properties to achieve our goals. We believe that a well-designed system could use existing techniques to offer a standardized way of private data analytics.
We decided to design and build ManaTEE, a framework that allows data owners to securely share their data for public research, with technically enforced privacy, accountability, and transparency guarantees. With the framework, researchers can gain accurate insights from private or proprietary datasets.

We're always looking for ways to innovate and add value to the TikTok experience. This year, we launched our new Content Posting API offering, Direct Post, to our global community. With Direct Post, our community can easily post content directly from third-party platforms to TikTok. Direct Post increases the resources and tools our community can choose from to easily navigate every stage of the creation process both on and off the platform.
Direct Post allows our community to post video content directly from third-party platforms to TikTok, with photo content coming soon. The feature builds on [Share to TikTok integrations](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/share-to-tiktok), providing the option to set captions, audience settings, and more within your third-party platform, sending it directly to TikTok through a single-click integration. Creators can also schedule long-form video content using Direct Post through social media managementnt platforms.
To use Direct Post, creators need to connect their TikTok account to the third-party platform. From there, partners are vetted through an audit process before granting them access to Content Posting API. Once these steps are taken, the third-party platform has permission to post on their TikTok account whenever the creators try to export media to TikTok.
## Highlights from our partners
We're excited to launch with key partners, including Adobe, a global leader enabling creativity for all and changing the world through digital experiences. Through our partnership with Adobe, creators can use the Direct Post feature in Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Express and share content directly to TikTok without leaving their workflow, making it easier than ever to create and share content.

At TikTok, we strive to work to ensure compliance and data security via our PDPO (Privacy and Data Protection Office). But what do privacy and data protection mean? And why is it important to protect sensitive information? We'll explore this more below. 
### What is Privacy and Data Protection?
Privacy and data protection center around safeguarding valuable personal information. Personal information is broadly defined as any data that identifies or could reasonably be linked to a specific individual, either directly or indirectly. This includes details that relate to or describe a person. However, definitions may vary across jurisdictions due to differing laws.
#### Sensitive Personal Information
Certain types of personal information require heightened protection, which is often referred to as sensitive personal information. What constitutes sensitive information may also differ depending on the laws of a region.
### Why Is it Important to Protect Personal Information?
If personal data is stolen, it could be used maliciously, including for monetization, impersonation, or reputational damage. Protecting personal information is critical in today's digital age.
#### For Companies Like TikTok
Users trust platforms like TikTok with their data, and this trust must be respected. Safeguarding data is not only a legal obligation, but also a critical factor in fostering user confidence. Data protection ensures that data collection, storage, use, and sharing are secure and lawful. Moreover, broader considerations like data transfers, data sovereignty, AI use, and safeguarding the data of younger users are integral to privacy and data protection practices.
### TikTok’s Commitment to Privacy

As AI-generated imagery becomes more prevalent, concerns about bias and fairness in the representation of human subjects have been a recurring concern among responsible tech practitioners and society at large. Various studies [1,2,3] show that many large-scale text-to-image models (T2Is) reinforce societal stereotypes, under or mis-represent certain demographic groups, and fail to align with input prompts in socially sensitive domains. To address these challenges, a team of researchers from TikTok AI Governance team has introduced a new framework designed to assess fairness in AI-generated images from different text-to-image models.
Fairness in the field of machine learning refers to the pursuit of reducing algorithmic bias in decision making processes. When it comes to image generation, such as for pictures of human faces, these decisions are highlighted by the choice of several visual aspects such as accessories, facial expressions, context, lighting, skin texture, and skin color, among others. The images are based on a textual prompt that sometimes contain demographic information like "a female lawyer," "Asian firefighter," and more. When prompts do not carry descriptive information, like gender, occupation, race or other demographics, the models interpret the text and have to make a decision on which demographics to represent, which in turn allows the implicit bias of image generation of large-scale text-to-image models to be accurately measured. 
There are many frameworks that analyse the fairness of the resulting image produced by T2I, but TikTok's recent model—coined INFELM (short for In-depth Fairness Evaluation of Large Text-To-Image Models)—scored a higher skintone precision and a stronger bias-sensitive alignment, considering demographic context and ethical societal values in comparison to previous works on the same topic. 
## Method
To develop this framework, researchers created 246 prompts in partnership with experts participating in the Product Equity Working Group of the Tech Accountability Coalition, an initiative managed by The Aspen Institute. The prompts were developed based on six different bias-sensitive domains to generate images as the basis to measure generation alignment, and depict the content demographic distribution of these prompts. Each prompt generated 100 images to be compared and aggregated as demographic models. Once everything was created, the results were then compared and measured for representation biases and alignment errors with actual demographics from authoritative sources such as the US Census Bureau. 
While fairness and biases may be subjective and vary in different cultural contexts and ethical perspectives, this research project takes a mathematical stance to determine bias based on a 20% variance (or mismatch) between expected distribution (for example, those of the US. Census Bureau) and actual model distribution (aggregated model).
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/d59be8e5df4dc0285e3acacc280a8f7e)
## Contributions
INFELM introduces an advancement in bias detection and fairness assessment for text-to-image models. Unlike existing audits, which often rely on subjective evaluations or broad statistical trends, INFELM introduces:
  * A Precision-Enhanced Skintone Classification Model: Utilizing facial topology and refined skin pixel representation, INFELM improves classification accuracy by 16.04%, ensuring more precise demographic analysis.
  * Bias-Sensitive Content Alignment Metrics: Evaluates whether AI-generated images faithfully represent the intent of text prompts, particularly in contexts related to gender, race, and professional identity.
  * A Generalizable Representation Bias Framework: Offers systematic measurements of demographic representation, highlighting disparities across different population groups.
  * Comprehensive Model Testing Across Socially Sensitive Domains: INFELM has been applied to multiple large-scale text-to-image models, uncovering persistent patterns of bias that impact real-world AI applications.
## An Improved Standard for AI Fairness Evaluation
This research-driven approach provides a structured methodology for evaluating representation bias, content alignment, and demographic inclusivity in multimodal AI systems. The framework can positively impact the field of AI systems in several ways. Firstly, it enables teams of AI Developers to evaluate and mitigate bias before deploying text-to-image models in consumer applications. Secondly, it allows regulators and policymakers to establish a quantifiable benchmark for fairness in AI-generated content, supporting ethical AI governance. Lastly, it helps industry leaders and communities to ensure compliance with fairness and accountability standards, building trust and safety in AI-driven creative tools.
As AI-generated content continues to shape digital experiences, frameworks like INFELM may be critical for ensuring inclusivity, reducing harm, and fostering transparency. By introducing a rigorous evaluation methodology, TikTok Innovation is setting a new precedent for fairness in multimodal AI.

JavaScript's great by itself. But if you want to scale up, to do large projects with large teams, everyone knows you need TypeScript. Amazingly, TypeScript doesn't change your JavaScript code all that much—it just checks for mistakes. And every new release of the compiler brings new notations and new safeguards that promise to make your code even better. But if you have thousands of source files, or thousands of TypeScript projects in TikTok's case, enabling these new checks can be a lot of work. You turn on a setting in tsconfig.json, and suddenly you might be looking at 5,000 build errors. That's too much to fix! What to do?
## Exempting old code
When modernizing coding standards, people quickly realize that we care most about **new code**. We certainly want to enforce best practices for new work, whereas often there isn't reasonable justification to go picking through thousands of old files. We can fix the old code later, when a new feature gives us a reason to work on those files.
The easiest way to exempt old code is to simply ignore errors in entire files. However, when our team researched this, it wasn't as easy as it sounds. The compiler configuration (tsconfig.json) can apply different checks to different file paths, but in practice this is clumsy and requires managing a delicate dependency boundary between old and new file groups. A much more powerful approach is to invoke the compiler once for all files, using a "wrapper" tool that intercepts errors and filters them for old files. We found a project 
## The need for scopes
There's a deeper problem, though: If we exempt an entire file, engineers can continue adding arbitrary amounts of code to that file without following best practices. Even if an engineer is a good citizen, converting one file at a time can be too time consuming. Instead, exemptions should apply to narrower scopes such as a function body within a file. 
The TypeScript compiler provides a `// @ts-ignore` code comment that can suppress a single error, similar to `// eslint-ignore-next-line` for ESLint. But for a large team, this leads to the "
Some other members of my team already went down this path with ESLint, which produced the `eslint-bulk` tool. You can read about it in our earlier post [A new ESLint feature for large codebases](https://developers.tiktok.com/blog/bulk-suppressions-a-new-eslint-feature-for-large-codebases). For today we'll focus on two key principles from that project:
  1. **The suppressions are stored in a separate machine-generated file.** When enabling new settings for old projects, the `eslint-bulk` command will do a "bulk" update of the file automatically. Using a separate file prevents "broken windows" in the source code: people know they shouldn't be editing the bulk suppressions file unless they are doing migrations.
  2. **A "scopeId" identifies regions within a source file.** The `eslint-bulk` tool introduced an identifier based on the syntax tree. For example, if you want to refer to `myMethod()` that is a member of `MyClass`, the scopeId might be `.MyClass.myMethod`. Unlike approaches that track ranges of line numbers, the scopeId is stable when adding/removing chunks of code or even reordering functions.
Leveraging these ideas, we created a new tool `ts-bulk-suppress` that applies the same principles for TypeScript bulk suppressions. We've tried to make the two tools as similar as possible, providing a consistent mental model for ESLint and TypeScript migrations.
### Give it a try!
Here's a quick look at how to use `ts-bulk-suppress` with your existing project:
  1. It's recommended to install the tool by running `pnpm install ts-bulk-suppress --dev`(instead of `pnpm`, you can substitute `npm` or `yarn` according to your package manager preference).
  2. As an example, let's assume that we just enabled `noImplicitAny` and are now facing thousands of errors. Run this command to automatically generate the **.ts-bulk-suppressions.json** file:
```
# Create a bulk.config.json file with suppressions for all compiler errorsts-bulk-suppress --gen-bulk-suppress
```
  3. Make sure the file is tracked by Git:
```
git add .ts-bulk-suppressions.json
git commit -m "Enabling bulk suppressions"
```
At this point, if you run the `tsc` command (the official TypeScript compiler), you will still see thousands of errors. But if you instead run `ts-bulk-suppress`, the suppressed errors will be hidden.
👉 For full documentation, check out our 
## Some advanced features
Here's a few other interesting features we included:
  * You can add manual rules to **.ts-bulk-suppressions.json**. For example, suppose that `my-project/src/legacy-sdk` contains hundreds of files that we never intend to fix. Rather than tracking thousands of individual suppressions, you could add a manual rule like this:
**my-project/.ts-bulk-suppressions.json**
```
  . . .
"patternSuppressors": [
     {
// Ignore codes TS7006 for all files under that directory:"pathRegExp": "/src/legacy-sdk/.*",
"codes": [7006]
     }
  ]
  . . .
```
* **Ignoring external errors** : The tool provides a way to ignore an error in files anywhere under the `node_modules` folder, as these files are typically not your team's responsibility. This is similar to 
* **Ignoring collateral errors in CI** : The compiler's semantic analysis sometimes produces situations where a change in one file creates an error in a seemingly unrelated file. When initially migrating a legacy project, it can be helpful for continuous integration (CI) jobs to ignore files that are not part of the changed fileset.
## How it went
Here are some results from our first round of migration:
Total migrated: | 51 | projects  
---|---|---  
Teams that used the "patternSuppressors" feature: | 4 | projects  
Teams that enabled "ignoreExternalError": | 43 | projects  
Total TypeScript files in these projects: | 18,998 | files  
Files with at least one bulk suppression: | 4,017 | files  
Files that did NOT require any suppressions: | 78.7% |   
This histogram highlights the top 10 most frequently suppressed errors during this migration:
**Count** | **Code** | **TypeScript error**  
---|---|---  
10,051 | TS2339 | Property '{0}' does not exist on type '{1}'.  
3,366 | TS7006 | Parameter '{0}' implicitly has an '{1}' type.  
3,234 | TS2322 | Type '{0}' is not assignable to type '{1}'.  
1,840 | TS2345 | Argument of type '{0}' is not assignable to parameter of type '{1}'.  
1,348 | TS18046 | '{0}' is of type 'unknown'.  
1,415 | TS7053 | Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type '{0}' can't be used to index type '{1}'.  
796 | TS2304 | Cannot find name '{0}'.  
719 | TS2307 | Cannot find module '{0}' or its corresponding type declarations.  
677 | TS6133 | '{0}' is declared but never used  
626 | TS7031 | Binding element '{0}' implicitly has an '{1}' type.  
Some of these errors sound nontrivial, but they are problems in the type system; the runtime code was previously working and continues to work without issues. The important result is that 78% of files can now move forward using best practices. The legacy issues can be fixed when (or if) new work is required for those files. Without a way to fix problems incrementally, we would not have been able to adopt the newer compiler configuration at all.
## The road ahead
Although `ts-bulk-suppress` enabled us to get more projects migrated to use our recommended checks, the story isn't over. We're planning more features such as integration with toolchains (that invoke `tsc` via an API), watch mode, and also support for the VS Code language service. The problems solved by this tool are not unique to TikTok. Anyone trying to modernize a large TypeScript codebase will face these same challenges. If you find this tool useful, maybe you can contribute to its development! Or simply create a GitHub issue and tell us about your experience. That's all for today!

At TikTok, we adhere to strict privacy principles that restrict the use of personal data solely to its consented purposes. For instance, user identifiers, such as phone numbers or email addresses—collected exclusively for authentication—are never reused to track behavior across apps or services. 
We follow established industry standards and privacy control frameworks to prevent unauthorized data access and operate under a zero-trust infrastructure with strong cryptographic enforcement. Sensitive data is encrypted locally on the user's device and can only be decrypted by the specific service for which it was intended—ensuring that no other service, internal or external, can access plaintext. This approach complements Transport Layer Security (TLS), which protects all communication between user devices and TikTok servers. 
To further strengthen our long-term security posture, we've deployed TikTok's first post-quantum cryptographic solution based on NIST standards—positioning us ahead of emerging threats.
## A Scalable Authenticated and Encrypted Channel
Our goal is to build a solution that scales to over one billion users while remaining operationally manageable for service teams. In our architecture, user devices handle encryption, while a centralized service is responsible for decryption. Asymmetric encryption allows devices to encrypt using the service's public key, but decryption on the server side is computationally expensive and reduces throughput. 
While symmetric encryption is more efficient, it requires a unique key per device—making it infeasible to cache billions of keys on each server and raising significant security concerns. Using an external key management service (KMS) introduces network latency and requires rigorous reliability under peak load conditions.
To address these challenges, we implemented envelope encryption. This service generates a unique data encryption key (DEK) for each device, encrypts it using a key encryption key (KEK), and stores only the KEK. User data is encrypted with the DEK, and the encrypted DEK is bundled with the payload. Only the service can decrypt the DEK using its KEK, ensuring secure and efficient access to data. We apply authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) for both the DEK and user data, establishing a stateless, high-throughput, cryptographically authenticated channel between each device and the service.
## Dispatching Keys to User Devices
To enable this model, the DEK must be securely delivered to the user device. This requires transmitting the DEK and its encrypted form through an authenticated and encrypted channel. For efficiency, we use standardized key delivery protocols such as the Diffie-Hellman Integrated Encryption Scheme (IES) (standardized in IEEE 1363a, ISO/IEC 18033-2, SECG SEC 1, and ANSI X9.63) and the Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) protocol (
In brief, these protocols allow two parties to establish a shared secret using public-key cryptography, which then secures further communication. We assume that the device has authenticated the service over TLS and obtained the service's public key out of band. Before encrypting any data, the device generates an ephemeral key pair and sends its public key to the service. The service replies with an encrypted payload containing a newly generated DEK and its encryption. The device then uses its private key and the service's public key to decrypt the response and extract the DEK, enabling secure, stateless communication.
## Post-Quantum Migration
While current protocols provide strong security, they rely on cryptographic algorithms that are vulnerable to quantum computing. Algorithms such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography can be broken by future quantum computers using attacks like Shor's algorithm. Although quantum attacks are not feasible today, it's crucial to begin migrating now to post-quantum cryptography to defend against “harvest now, decrypt later” threats—where adversaries archive encrypted data with the intention to decrypt it once quantum capabilities mature.
To address this, NIST has standardized a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (
Unfortunately, hybrid versions of HPKE and IES are not yet fully standardized, and securely combining two key encapsulation mechanisms in HPKE introduces subtle design challenges. As a conservative choice, we implemented a hybrid post-quantum IES using NIST-standardized elliptic curve cryptography and the module-lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (MLKEM). This approach balances performance with standard conformance. 
We are actively monitoring emerging standards, such as post-quantum HPKE, and may adopt hybrid KEM-based implementations like 
This deployment marks TikTok's first production rollout of post-quantum cryptography. We've upgraded key infrastructure components, including our internal key management service, to support post-quantum key formats. The solution is already in use across several business-critical scenarios and is on track to rollout to all users. We remain committed to expanding adoption of our post-quantum HPKE-based solution to further strengthen the privacy and security of TikTok's global community.

In this article, we explore how combining satellite-based Internet services with cellular networks can enhance global connectivity, offering improved performance through dynamic network integration and adaptive data routing strategies.
## What the study explored
A research team conducted a real-world test across five U.S. states, traveling more than 2,360 miles to evaluate the performance of Starlink and major cellular networks. They measured internet speed, latency, and connection stability in a variety of conditions, including while in motion.
Two versions of Starlink were tested:
  1. **Starlink Roam** , designed for stationary use, though sometimes used on the move.
  2. **Starlink Mobility** , specifically designed for vehicles and other mobile platforms.
They compared these across three major U.S cellular networks to assess which technology delivered better performance in different environments.
## What the study revealed
### Starlink struggles while moving
**Starlink Mobility** outperformed **Starlink Roam** during travel, but both experienced dropped data compared to cellular networks. As a result, Starlink connections were less reliable for tasks like video calls or gaming on the move.
### Better for rural areas, worse for cities
In rural areas, with limited or no cellular coverage, Starlink provided a reliable alternative with strong speeds.
In cities, Starlink struggled. Buildings and other obstacles blocked signals, making cellular networks the more reliable option.
### Latency isn't a dealbreaker
Although Starlink uses satellites, its one-way latency (delay in sending data) averaged just 1.8 milliseconds, similar to cellular networks. That's a significant improvement over older satellite Internet options, making Starlink a viable choice for everyday use.
## Combining Starlink and cellular could be the future
Combining Starlink and cellular networks could significantly improve Internet speeds and reliability. The study found that using both through multipath networking could increase speeds by up to 66% compared to relying on just one connection.
However, to make this integration seamless, smarter software is needed to manage and balance data traffic efficiently across both networks.
## Why this study matters
This study shows that no single network performs best everywhere. Starlink excels in places with weak or no cellular coverage, while cellular networks remain stronger in urban areas. By combining both, you can experience the best of both worlds!
## Looking ahead
For now, people in rural areas can benefit from Starlink's expanding network, while mobile users should still rely on cellular networks in cities. But as networking technology evolves, we could soon see seamless integration of both, offering faster, more reliable Internet for everyone.

The initiative aligns with TikTok's ongoing efforts to build trust and amplify our commitment to encouraging people to #BeCyberSmart. Specifically, by working with public and private sector leaders, we aim to help amplify adoption of security measures like two-step verification (2SV) to help protect users and disrupt criminal activity, such as account takeovers.

# Migration guidance for OAuth endpoints
If your app is not configured for web and does not use Login Kit for Web, you may ignore this document.
TikTok is making some changes to our developer products to improve security for developers and TikTok end users. As our first improvement, we are improving our OAuth API for obtaining user authorization and managing user access. Our new v2 OAuth API is based on industry standards for OAuth 2.0 as described in 
This document explains how to migrate from v1 OAuth API to v2 OAuth API, including: 
  1. Updating your Login Kit configuration to use web redirect URIs for v2 OAuth APIs. 
  2. Updating your service integration to work with v2 OAuth API endpoints, requests, and responses.
## Timeline
v1 OAuth will stop working on **February 29****, 202****4** for web apps! We recommend you migrate to v2 OAuth APIs as soon as possible using the instructions below.
  * **May 12, 2023** : All new apps registered on TikTok for Developers must use v2 OAuth APIs.
  * **June 12, 2023** : Developers will no longer be able to add or modify redirect domains in their Login Kit configurations for web apps. 
  * **February 29****, 202****4** : End of life for v1 OAuth API, _for web apps only_. API calls to old endpoints will be rejected.
## Required Actions
### Register redirect URI
First, follow these steps to register redirect URIs for your web applications:
  1. Find all apps with Login Kit enabled for web:
    1. Navigate to the page to **Manage apps**.
    2. For each app you own, check if Login Kit is added as a product.
    3. If Login Kit is added, check if the **Configure for Web** toggle is on.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/602781c8dae7dea0f16e51d545a9b5e0)
  1. You will see a banner asking you to provide a redirect URI. You must add at least one URI but you may add up to 10 redirect URIs.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/cb5e724b8a03792a8e7bc6f86694790c)
Your redirect URIs must:
  * be less than 512 characters.
  * be absolute and begin with `https`. For example:
    * Correct: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
    * Incorrect: `dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
  * be static. Parameters will be denied. For example:
    * Correct: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
    * Incorrect: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/?id=1`
  * not include a fragment or hash character (#). For example:
    * Correct: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
    * Incorrect: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/#100`
You don't need to remove previously configured redirect domains.
### Use v2 OAuth APIs
After you register a redirect URI for your app, you can use v2 OAuth APIs to initiate user authorization and manage tokens. The following table summarizes the endpoint mappings between v1 and v2 APIs. Please follow the guidance [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/oauth-user-access-token-management) for more details. 
**Functionality** | **V1 endpoint** | **V2 endpoint**  
---|---|---  
Initiate authorization grant flow | `https://www.tiktok.com/auth/authorize/` | `https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/`  
Get an access token | `https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/access_token/` |  `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/` With `grant_type=authorization_code`  
Refresh an access token | `https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/refresh_token/` |  `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/` With `grant_type=refresh_token`  
Revoke an access token | `https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/revoke/` | `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/revoke/`  
## Frequently Asked Questions
**1. Can I still use v1****OAuth****APIs before my app migrates to v2?**
Our v1 OAuth APIs are available for use until their end of life for web apps on February 29, 2024. However, **you should not use v1 and v2 APIs in a mixed way**. For example, you should not use a v1 refresh token API to refresh an access token using the refresh token obtained by v2 token API.
**2. Do v2****OAuth****APIs support customized query parameters in redirect URI? If not, what should I do if I use such redirect URI in v1****https://www.tiktok.com/auth/authorize/****endpoint?**
No, query parameters are not allowed in redirect URI. However, you can fully use the `state` field to include any customized information. This field will be included in the redirect URI returned by service and the value will not be changed.
**3. Are there any changes to error handling for****v2****OAuth****APIs?**
Yes. Error handling for v2 APIs is different from v1 APIs. For more details, see [OAuth error handling](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/oauth-error-handling).
**4.** **Is****application/x-www-form-urlencoded****the only supported content type for v2 token management APIs?**
Yes. You must set `Content-Type` header with value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` before calling v2 token management APIs. Other content type headers are not supported.
**5. If my client key is also configured for Android or iOS, should I migrate mobile apps to v2 APIs?**
No, mobile apps should continue using v1 OAuth endpoints until further notice.

# Migration Guidance - QR Code Authorization V2
This guide only pertains to you if you are using QR code authorization v1 (or Login Kit with QR code).
## Overview
TikTok is making some changes to their developer products to improve privacy and security for developers and TikTok end users. As part of these changes, we are introducing an update to our QR code authorization (or Login Kit with QR code). **If your apps do not integrate with QR code authorization, you do not need to perform the migration.**
This guidance explains the necessary steps to complete this migration. Please note that if you **do not** complete the migration by **02/29/2024** , your apps will not receive the correct response from QR code authorization APIs.
## How to migrate
### Step 1: Check QR code authorization usage
To determine if your apps need to perform the migration, check if you are using below APIs:
  * GET: `https://open-api.tiktok.com/v0/oauth/get_qrcode`
  * GET: `https://open-api.tiktok.com/v0/oauth/check_qrcode`
These two APIs will be deprecated by **02/29/2024**. Once you confirm you need to perform the migration, go to Step 2 to complete the migration.
### Step 2: Upgrade to v2 QR code authorization API
The following two APIs are provided to replace the previous ones:
  * POST: `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/get_qrcode/`
  * POST: `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/check_qrcode/`
Along with the API path, there are also some parameter changes in the new APIs. More detailed information about integrating the new APIs can be found [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-qr-code-authorization). 
## FAQs
**Can I still use v1****QR****code authorization?**
If you are currently using the QR code authorization v1, you can use it until **02/29/2024**. After **02/29/2024** , only v2 QR code authorization will be supported. It is recommended that you perform the migration as soon as possible.

# Migration notice for Share Video API (Video Kit for Web)
TikTok is making some changes to our developer APIs to improve user privacy based on data localization best practices. As a result of these changes, we are deprecating our **Share Video****API** (**Video Kit with Web**) by **September 10****, 2023**. To continue supporting video uploads using APIs, we are launching our new **Content Posting API**. 
This document provides a migration path to our new API and describes our enhancements for user privacy.
## Timeline
Share Video API will stop working on **September 10th****, 2023**! Please migrate to our new Content Posting API as soon as possible using the instructions below.
  * **April 27, 2023** : All new apps registered on TikTok for Developers must use the new Content Posting API.
  * **June 10, 2023** : Developers must migrate their existing app integrations to use Content Posting API. API calls to legacy Share Video API are not guaranteed to succeed. 
  * **September 10****, 2023** : End of life for Share Video API. All API calls will be rejected.
**Update** (June 9, 2023): To provide more time for developers to migrate, end of life for Share Video API has been moved from June 16, 2023 to September 10, 2023. However, video uploads and API calls are still not guaranteed to succeed from the previously communicated date of June 10, 2023. We recommend you migrate to Content Posting API as soon as possible.
## New Concepts
TikTok's Content Posting API supports new capabilities including downloading videos from developer owned URLs and automatic creation of a post on the creator's behalf. To keep this migration seamless for your existing product and integration scenario, we have focused this guide on the equivalent mode for Share Video API: Uploading videos to the TikTok's user's account without creating a post. 
For details on other modes, consult the [Content Posting API documentation](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-get-started).
## Migrating to Content Posting API
**Note** : Uploading videos via Content Posting API requires the `video.upload` scope. If you were previously using our Share Video API, you would have already been approved for this scope.
### Share Video Endpoint → Content Posting Endpoint
The Content Posting API is located at a different endpoint than our old Share Video API.
  * Old Share Video endpoint: `https://open-api.tiktok.com/share/video/upload/`
  * Equivalent Content Posting API endpoint: `https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/`
### Share Video Request → Content Posting Request
Our old Share Video API was invoked using a `POST` request containing the creator's access token and open ID in the query parameters and the video file in the request body as form-data. With cURL, this looks like:
```
curl --location 'open-api.tiktok.com/share/video/upload/?open_id={open-id}&access_token={access-token}' \
--form 'video=@"/path/to/file.mp4"'
```
For reference, see our old [Share Video API documentation](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/web-video-kit-with-web).
Our new Content Posting API requires two-step upload. First, invoke our API endpoint using a `POST` request with the creator's access token in the request header (not as query parameters):
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/' \--header 'Authorization: Bearer {access-token}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
--data '{
"source_info": {
"source": "FILE_UPLOAD",
"video_size": 30567100,
"chunk_size" : 30567100,
"total_chunk_count": 1    }
}'
```
Set the `source` attribute to `FILE_UPLOAD`. Content Posting API supports uploading larger files using chunks, but this concept can be ignored for the purpose of this migration as files uploaded via the older Share Video API were limited to 64MB and can fit into a single chunk file. Simply set the `video_size` and `chunk_size` to your video file's size and set `total_chunk_count` to **1**.
**Note** : The `open_id` is no longer required.
Next, extract the `upload_url` from the `data` struct of the successful response:
```
{
"data": {
"publish_id": "v_inbox_file~v2.123456789",
"upload_url": "https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=Xza123"    },
"error": {
"code": "ok",
"message": "",
"log_id": "2022101122484420000000000000"     }
}
```
Using a `PUT` request, upload the file to the provided `upload_url`: 
```
curl --location --request PUT 'https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=Xza123' \
--header 'Content-Range: bytes 0-30567099/30567100' \
--header 'Content-Type: video/mp4' \
--data'@/path/to/file/example.mp4'
```
For detailed schemas and more information about transferring files, see Uploading media with our Content Posting API.
### Share Video Webhooks → Content Posting Webhooks
Finally, remember to handle webhook events for the Content Posting API to be notified of video status.
  * Webhook event type changes:
    * `video.upload.failed` → `post.publish.failed`
    * `video.publish.complete` → `post.publish.complete`
  * Webhook event field change:
    * `share_id` → `publish_id`
## Why is this migration happening?
Based on TikTok's commitment to protecting user data, we are making several upgrades to our systems to enhance user privacy. These include storing data in regional data centers closest to the users and minimizing cross-regional data flows to the greatest extent possible while still enabling global interoperability for the TikTok for Developers community.
These enhancements are available in our new Content Posting API.

# Migration Guidance - User Info APIs Scope Migration
## Introduction
TikTok is making some changes to our developer products to improve privacy and security for developers and TikTok end users. As part of these changes, we are introducing a few updates to our authorization scopes used with User Info APIs. **If your apps do not integrate with Login Kit or do not use User Info APIs, you do not need to perform the migration.** This guidance explains the necessary steps to complete the updates for User Info APIs. Please note that if you **do not** complete the migration by 02/29/2024, your apps may not receive the correct response from User Info APIs.
###  Step 1: Check User Info APIs usage
To determine if your apps need to perform the migration, check if you are using User Info APIs to obtain any fields listed in the table below.
  * POST:https://open-api.tiktok.com/user/info/ and 
  * GET:https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/user/info/) 
**New Scope and Field Relationship Table**
**Field** | **Description** | **Existing Scope** | **New Scope**  
---|---|---|---  
bio_description | User's bio description if there is a valid one | user.info.basic | user.info.profile  
profile_deep_link | The link to the user's TikTok profile page | user.info.basic | user.info.profile  
is_verified | Whether TikTok has provided a verified badge to the account after confirming that it belongs to the user it represents |  user.info.basic   
| user.info.profile  
username | User's username | user.info.basic | user.info.profile  
follower_count | User's follower count | user.info.basic | user.info.stats  
following_count | The number of accounts that the user is following  | user.info.basic | user.info.stats  
likes_count | The total number of likes received by the user across all of their videos | user.info.basic | user.info.stats  
video_count | The total number of publicly posted videos by the user | user.info.basic |  user.info.stats   
The **user.info****.basic** scope can't be used to get all the fields in the table above. If your app uses any of these fields, your API client needs to send the right scope associated with the fields as shown in the following steps. Going forward, the **user.info****.basic** scope can only retrieve "open_id", "union_id", "avatar_url", "avatar_url_100", "avatar_large_url" and "display_name".
### Step 2: Apply new scope
After you have confirmed that your apps need to perform the migration, the next step is to apply the new scopes.
  * Click the **Manage apps** on the homepage and select your application.
  * Make sure that the application has added the "Scopes" product and locate the "Scopes" product section.
  * Click on **Edit Scope** , search and add the relevant scopes, save changes, and submit for review.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/14814c197f977b1c8ca7ef6eca8c3463)
Once your changes have been approved, you can authorize the new scopes.
### Step 3: Re-authorize new scope
After you have added the new scopes to your apps, you will need to perform a reauthorization with your users. Add the new scopes to your authorization parameter and ask users to give updated scope permissions through your Login Kit page. You can find more information about this in [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-overview).
### Step 4: Call User Info APIs with new token
After you have confirmed that your users have authorized the new scopes for your apps and obtained the new access_token, you can use User Info APIs to retrieve the new fields. We recommend using the v2 User Info API, as the v1 User Info API will be deprecated soon. More detailed information can be found [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-get-user-info).
### Banner
We will be monitoring the usage of User Info APIs for the fields mentioned above. If your applications do not meet our new requirements, a banner will be added to your app's homepage as a notice. This banner will be removed once migration is complete. 
Please note that it may take some time for us to collect the data and verify the migration. You may see the banner for up to one week after completing the migration.
### FAQs
####  **1. Can I still use "****user.info****.basic" to retrieve fields in the table above before the 0****2****/2****9****/202****4****?**
Yes. You can still use "user.info.basic" to access "bio_description", "profile_deep_link", "is_verified", "follower_count", "following_count", "like_count" and "video_count" before 02/29/2024. However, after this time, if your application has not completed the migration and still queries for these fields, you will receive a "scope_not_authorized" error with HTTP status code of `401 Unauthorized`. Therefore, you are requested to complete the migration as soon as possible.
####  **2. Can I still use v1 user info****API****to get those fields?**
Yes, you can still use [v1 User Info API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v1-user-info) to retrieve those fields, but we recommend using our [v2 user info API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-get-user-info) as we plan to deprecate the v1 API in the future.

# Add a Sandbox
**Sandbox** mode is a restricted environment that allows you to try out integrations without having to submit your app for review. You can create multiple sandboxes for your app to experiment with different configurations without compromising the live version of your app. You can create up to 5 sandboxes. 
## Prerequisites 
Before registering your app, do the following:
  1. Create a TikTok developer account from [our signup page](https://developers.tiktok.com/signup) using your email.
  2. Create or join an [organization](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/working-with-organizations/) representing the owning group of the app. This step is highly recommended but not required.
You will also need access to a URL decoder to [authorize target users](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/add-a-sandbox?enter_method=left_navigation%2F#authorize_target_users_with_login_kit). 
## Create a Sandbox
This workflow demonstrates how to create your first sandbox. 
  1. Go to the **Manage apps** page, then select an app or **Connect an app** if you don't have one yet.
  2. On the app page, switch the toggle next to your app's name to **Sandbox**. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/edcb9ea5ba07e6136636cb2fdb1ec2fe)
  1. Click the **Create Sandbox** button, then enter a name. You can choose to clone an existing configuration from your app's production versions or another sandbox. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/1da64668f04efd425e7d3f86c834b50d)
  1. Click **Confirm** to create the sandbox. 
  2. Configure the sandbox as desired by editing **App details** and adding products. 
Note: Sandbox mode does not offer access to Content Posting API for public videos or Data Portability API. 
  1. Click **Apply changes** to save changes and make your configuration take effect. 
To create another sandbox, click the [**+**] button (**Create Sandbox**) in the left navigation panel. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/bca5622c079cf61412f2773cb46961fe)
## Manage target users 
Adding target users to a sandbox allows them to try out your sandbox configurations. To add a TikTok account that you own as a target user, you must provide its login credentials. You can add up to 10 accounts. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/b96946aa5493d8c17de62e2f25d51b5d)
  1. Go to **Sandbox settings** on the app page. 
  2. Under **Target users** , click **Add account**. You will be redirected to log in to a TikTok account. 
  3. Log in to the TikTok account and agree to the TikTok Developer Terms of Service. 
Your target users will be displayed on your app page after they have been added. Results may take up to an hour to show after you refresh the page.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/10669c5c932bae02c680c6d1229a7aed)
### Authorize target users with Login Kit
After you add target users, you may authorize them if you want to use Login Kit and the other products dependent on it. Authorization workflows for Web, Desktop, iOS, and Android are available in the [Login Kit documentation](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-overview). 
## Import your Sandbox configuration 
You can import a sandbox's configuration to a **Draft** of your app in production. Doing so will overwrite the draft's existing configuration with the chosen sandbox configuration. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/55d7d912f013e1a9242d7df9ebb6af77)
Note: You can only import a sandbox configuration to a **Draft** in **Production** mode. 
  1. On the app page, switch the toggle next to your app's name to **Production**. 
  2. Click **Draft** in the left navigation panel. 
  3. Click **Import** , then select the sandbox you want to import from. 
If you have a version of the app that has been approved and is live, you can revert back to that configuration by clicking **Revert to Live version** in the**Import** dropdown.
When you are ready to [submit your app](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app#submit_your_app_for_review), make sure that it follows our [app review guidelines](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/app-review-guidelines).

# Client Access Token Management
Client access token is a type of access token that does not need user authorization. This is typically used by clients to access resources about themselves or a TikTok application, rather than to access a user's resources. The use cases are to access [Research API](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/) and [Commercial Content API](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/commercial-content-api/).
### Endpoint
_POST_ https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/
### Headers
**Key** | **Value**  
---|---  
Content-Type | application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
### Request body parameters
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
client_key   
| String | The unique identification key provisioned to the partner.  
client_secret | String | The unique identification secret provisioned to the partner.  
grant_type | String | Its value should always be set as `client_credentials`.  
### Response struct
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
access_token | String | The generated client access token.  
expires_in   
| Int64 | The expiration for the `access_token` in seconds. **It****is valid for 2 hours after the initial issuance**.  
token_type | String | The value should be `Bearer`.  
Make sure to store these values on your back end as they are needed to persist access.
### Example
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
--data-urlencode 'client_key=CLIENT_KEY' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'
```
If the request is successful, the response will look like the following:
```
{
"access_token": "clt.example12345Example12345Example",
"expires_in": 7200,
"token_type": "Bearer"}
```
If the request is not successful, an error response body will be returned in the response, like the following:
```
{
"error": "invalid_request",
"error_description": "Client secret is missed in request.",
"log_id": "202206221854370101130062072500FFA2"}
```
At the time of this writing, this guide is applicable to [Research API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/research-api-get-started) and [Commercial Content API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/commercial-content-api-getting-started).

                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/commercial-content-api-getting-started?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# Getting Started
This guide will show you how to use the Commercial Content API. Learn how to use the Commercial Content API to query ad data and fetch public advertiser data in the following use case example.
# View your client registration
Once your application is approved, a research client will be generated for your project. You can view your approved research projects [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/research/). Select a project from the list to see the research client details.
The provided **Client key** and **Client secret** are required to connect to the Commercial Content API endpoints. The client key and secret are hidden by default but can be displayed by clicking the **Display** button (eye icon).
**Note:** The client secret is a credential used to authenticate your connection to TikTok's APIs. Do not share this with anyone!
# Obtain a client access token
Once you have obtained the client key and secret for your project, [generate a client access token](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/client-access-token-management). Add this access token in the authorization header of the http requests to connect to the Commercial Content API endpoints.
# Query TikTok public content data
The cURL command below shows an example of how you can query the TikTok ads created in Italy between January 2, 2021 to January 9, 2021 with the keyword "coffee". 
```
curl -X POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/research/adlib/ad/query/?fields=ad,ad_group' \
 -H 'authorization: bearer clt.example12345Example12345Example' \
 -d '{ 
         "filters": {
            "ad_published_date_range": {
                 "min": "20221001",
                 "max": "20230510"
             },
            "country": "IT"
         }, 
        "search_term": "coffee",
        "max_count": 20
    }'
```
## Pagination
If the total number of ads that match the search criteria is larger than the maximum number of ads that can be returned in a single request, the response data will be returned with different requests.
**Field** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required?**  
---|---|---|---|---  
max_count | number | The maximum count of TikTok videos in the response. The default value is 10 and the maximum value is 50. | 12 |  FALSE   
search_id | string | The ID of a previous search to provide sequential calls for paging. | "eyJsYXN0X3NvcnQiOls3NDA3OCwiMzUwNDIwOTgzOD" | FALSE  
### First page
When you send the first request, you do not need to set the `search_id` in the request body. In the http response, `has_more` and `search_id` are returned, which are used in the subsequent requests.
```
Try out this request:
curl -X POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/research/adlib/ad/query/?fields=ad,ad_group' \
  -H 'authorization: bearer clt.example12345Example12345Example' \
  -d '{ 
          "filters": {
              "ad_published_date_range": {
                 "min": "20221001",
                 "max": "20230510"
              },
              "country": "IT"
           }, 
          "search_term": "coffee",
          "max_count": 20
       }'
```
The following example data is returned from the response.
```
{
"data": {
"has_more": true,
"search_id": "eyJsYXN0X3NvcnQiOls3NDA3OCwiMzUwNDIwOTgzOD",
"ads": [
            ...
        ]
    },
"error": {
        ...
    }
 }
```

**Tip** : You can enable [email notifications](https://developers.tiktok.com/settings/#notification-setting) to get our latest product updates.
**New:** Content Posting API now supports [posting photos](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-photo-post#direct_post)!
# Get Started
This guide demonstrates how to use the Content Posting API to post content directly to TikTok. 
## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need the following:
  1. A valid video if you want to post videos:
     * Ensure you have a video file in one of the [supported formats](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#video_restrictions), such as MP4 + H.264, stored on your local machine.
     * Alternatively, you can provide the URL of a video from your verified domain or URL prefix. Learn how to [verify your domain or URL prefix](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#pull_from_url).
     * Learn more about [video restrictions](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#video_restrictions).
  2. A valid photo if you want to post photos:
     * You must provide a URL of a photo from your verified domain or URL prefix. Learn how to [verify your domain or URL prefix](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#pull_from_url).
     * Learn more about [photo restrictions.](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#image_restrictions)
  3. A [registered app](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app) on the TikTok for Developers website.
  4. Add the Content Posting API product to your app as shown below.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/f7e446de7adf4a97a8e606d1db9f0003)
  1. To enable the direct posting of content on authorized users' profiles, you need to enable the Direct Post configuration for the Content Posting API in your app, as shown below.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/78cba97728b274ecdaeefa5e30c34946)
  1. Get approval and authorization of the `video.publish` scope. Learn more about [scopes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview).
    1. Your app must be approved for the `video.publish` scope.
    2. The target TikTok user must have authorized your app for the `video.publish` scope.
  2. The access token and open ID of the TikTok user who authorized your app. Learn how to [obtain the access token and open ID](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens).
**Note:** All content posted by unaudited clients will be restricted to private viewing mode. Once you have successfully tested your integration, to lift the restrictions on content visibility, your API client must [undergo an audit](https://developers.tiktok.com/application/content-posting-api) to verify compliance with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/tik-tok-developer-terms-of-service?lang=en).
## Post directly to TikTok
This section demonstrates how to successfully post a video or photo to a creator's TikTok account. 
### Query Creator Info
To initiate a direct post to a creator's account, you must first use the Query Creator Info endpoint to get the target creator's latest information. For more information about why creator information is necessary, refer to these [UX guidelines](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-sharing-guidelines).
Request:
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/creator_info/query/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8'
```
Response:
```
200 OK

"error": {
"code": "ok",
"message": "",
"log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F3"     }
```
### Post a video
To initiate video upload on TikTok's server, you must invoke the [Direct Post Video](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-direct-post) endpoint. You have the following two options:
  * If you have the video file locally, set the source parameter to `FILE_UPLOAD` in your request.
  * If the video is hosted on a URL, set the source parameter to `PULL_FROM_URL`.
#### Example
Example using `source=FILE_UPLOAD`:
Request:
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/video/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "post_info": {
    "title": "this will be a funny #cat video on your @tiktok #fyp",
    "privacy_level": "MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS",
    "disable_duet": false,
    "disable_comment": true,
    "disable_stitch": false,
    "video_cover_timestamp_ms": 1000
  },
  "source_info": {
      "source": "FILE_UPLOAD",
      "video_size": 50000123,
      "chunk_size":  10000000,
      "total_chunk_count": 5
  }
}'
```
```
200 OK
{
"data": {
"publish_id": "v_pub_file~v2-1.123456789",
"upload_url": "https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=Xza123"    },
"error": {
"code": "ok",
"message": "",
"log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F3"     }
}
```
Example using `source=PULL_FROM_URL`:
Request:
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/video/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
--data-raw '{
  "post_info": {
    "title": "this will be a funny #cat video on your @tiktok #fyp",
    "privacy_level": "MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS",
    "disable_duet": false,
    "disable_comment": true,
    "disable_stitch": false,
    "video_cover_timestamp_ms": 1000
  },
  "source_info": {
      "source": "PULL_FROM_URL",
      "video_url": "https://example.verified.domain.com/example_video.mp4",
  }
}'
```
```
200 OK
{
"data": {
"publish_id": "v_pub_url~v2.123456789"    },
"error": {
"code": "ok",
"message": "",
"log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F4"     }
}
```
If you are using `source=FILE_UPLOAD`
  1. Extract the `upload_url` and `publish_id` from the response data.
  2. [Send the video ](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-direct-post)from your local filesystem to the extracted `upload_url` using a PUT request. The video processing will occur asynchronously once the upload is complete.
```
curl --location --request PUT 'https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=Xza123' \
--header 'Content-Range: bytes 0-30567099/30567100' \
--header 'Content-Type: video/mp4' \
--data '@/path/to/file/example.mp4'
```
With the `publish_id` returned earlier, check for status updates using the [Get Post Status ](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-get-video-status)endpoint.
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/status/fetch/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
--data '{
    "publish_id": "v_pub_url~v2.123456789"
}'
```
### Post photos
To initiate photo upload on TikTok's server, you must invoke the [Content Posting API endpoint.](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-photo-post)
Note:
There are differences between the photo post endpoint and the existing video post endpoint.
* Use /v2/post/publish/content/init/ to upload photos instead of /v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/
* The `post_mode` and `media_type` is required in request.body
#### Example
Request:
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/content/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "post_info": {
        "title": "funny cat",
        "description": "this will be a #funny photo on your @tiktok #fyp",
        "disable_comment": true,
        "privacy_level": "PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE",
        "auto_add_music": true
    },
    "source_info": {
        "source": "PULL_FROM_URL",
        "photo_cover_index": 1,
        "photo_images": [
            "https://tiktokcdn.com/obj/example-image-01.webp",
            "https://tiktokcdn.com/obj/example-image-02.webp"
        ]
    },
    "post_mode": "DIRECT_POST",
    "media_type": "PHOTO"
}'
```
```
200 OK
{
"data": {
"publish_id": "p_pub_url~v2.123456789"    },
"error": {
"code": "ok",
"message": "",
"log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F3"     }

# Get Started
This guide shows you how to use the Content Posting API to upload content to TikTok. 
  1. A valid video if you want to upload videos:
     * Ensure you have a video file in one of the [supported formats](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#video_restrictions), such as MP4 + H.264, stored on your local machine.
     * Alternatively, you can provide a URL of a video from your verified domain or URL prefix. Learn how to [verify your domain or URL prefix](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#pull_from_url).
     * Learn more about [video restrictions](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#video_restrictions).
  2. A valid photo if you want to upload photos:
     * You need to provide a URL of a photo from your verified domain or URL prefix. Learn how to [verify your domain or URL prefix](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#pull_from_url).
     * Learn more about [photo restrictions.](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide#image_restrictions)
  3. A [registered app](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app) on the TikTok for Developers website.
  4. Add the content posting API product to your app as shown below.
  1. Get approval and authorization of the `video.upload` scope. Learn more about [scopes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview).
    1. Your app must be approved for the `video.upload` scope.
    2. The target TikTok user must have authorized your app for the `video.upload` scope.
  2. The access token and open ID of the TikTok user who authorized your app. Learn how to [obtain the access token and open ID](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens).

### Upload a video
To initiate video upload on TikTok's servers, you must invoke the [Content Posting API - Video Upload](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-upload-video) endpoint. You have the following two options:
  * If you have the video file locally, set the source parameter to `FILE_UPLOAD` in your request.
  * if the video is hosted on a URL, set the source parameter to `PULL_FROM_URL`.
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "source_info": {
        "source": "FILE_UPLOAD",
        "video_size": exampleVideoSize,
        "chunk_size" : exampleVideoSize,
        "total_chunk_count": 1
    }
}'
```
```
200 OK
{
"data": {
"publish_id": "v_inbox_file~v2.123456789",
"upload_url": "https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=Xza123"    },
"error": {
"code": "ok",
"message": "",
"log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F3"     }
}
```
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "source_info": {
        "source": "PULL_FROM_URL",
        "video_url": "https://example.verified.domain.com/example_video.mp4",
    }
}'
```
```
200 OK
{
"data": {
"publish_id": "v_inbox_url~v2.123456789"    },
"error": {
"code": "ok",
"message": "",
"log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F4"     }
}
```
If you are using `source=FILE_UPLOAD`:
  1. Extract the `upload_url` and `publish_id` from the response data.
  2. [Send the video](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-upload-video) from your local filesystem to the extracted `upload_url` using a PUT request. The video processing will occur asynchronously once the upload is complete.
With the `publish_id` returned earlier, check for status updates using the [Get Post Status](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-get-video-status) endpoint.
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/status/fetch/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
--data '{
    "publish_id": "v_inbox_file~v2.123456789"
}'
```
### Upload photos
To initiate photo upload on TikTok's server, you must invoke the [Content Posting API endpoint.](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-photo-post)
Note:
There are differences between the photo post endpoint and the existing video post endpoint.
  * Use /v2/post/publish/content/init/ to upload photos instead of /v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/
  * The `post_mode` and `media_type` are required parameters in request.body
  * There are additional parameters supported, such as title and description.
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/content/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "post_info": {
        "title": "funny cat",
        "description": "this will be a #funny photo on your @tiktok #fyp"
    },
    "source_info": {
        "source": "PULL_FROM_URL",
        "photo_cover_index": 1,
        "photo_images": [
            "https://tiktokcdn.com/obj/example-image-01.webp",
            "https://tiktokcdn.com/obj/example-image-02.webp"
        ]
    },
    "post_mode": "MEDIA_UPLOAD",
    "media_type": "PHOTO"
}'
```

**New:** Content Posting API now supports [posting photos](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-photo-post)!
# Media Transfer Guide
This guide explains the process of transferring media files to TikTok servers when using the Content Posting API.
## File upload
Using this method, you can transfer your media to TikTok using HTTP. Upon [initializing your video upload](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-upload-video#initialize_video_upload) with `source=FILE_UPLOAD`, an `upload_url` will be returned. You must send the media binary to this URL.
To learn how to send videos to TikTok servers and for details on the HTTP request (endpoint, request and response schema, and headers), see the API reference for the [Upload Video endpoint](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-upload-video) or the [Direct Post endpoint](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-direct-post).
### Work with chunks
#### Chunk restrictions
  * The value of `total_chunk_count` should be equal to `video_size` divided by `chunk_size`, rounded down to the nearest integer.
  * Each chunk must be at least 5 MB but no greater than 64 MB, except for the final chunk, which can be greater than `chunk_size` (up to 128 MB) to accommodate any trailing bytes.
  * Videos with a total size less than 5 MB must be uploaded as a whole, with `chunk_size` equal to the entire video's byte size. Videos with a total size greater than 64 MB must be uploaded in multiple chunks.
  * There must be a minimum of 1 chunk and a maximum of 1000 chunks.
  * File chunks must be uploaded sequentially.
#### Media transfer HTTP schema
```
PUT {UPLOAD_URL} HTTP /1.1Content-Type: {MIME_TYPE}
Content-Length: {BYTE_SIZE_OF_THIS_CHUNK}
Content-Range: bytes {FIRST_BYTE}-{LAST_BYTE}/{TOTAL_BYTE_LENGTH}
BINARY_FILE_DATA
```
#### Examples
##### Chunk upload
In this example, there is a file with a size of 50,000,123 bytes. The chunk size is specified to be 10,000,000 bytes. The trailing 123 bytes is merged into the 10,000,000-byte chunk to meet the restriction that each chunk must be greater than 5 MB.
Example _UPLOAD_URL=_`https://upload.us.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=chunkexample` will be shared across all chunks.
**Variable** | **1st Request** | **2nd Request** | **3rd Request** | **4th Request** | **5th Request**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
_MIME_TYPE_ | video/mp4 | video/mp4 | video/mp4 | video/mp4 | video/mp4  
_TOTAL_BYTE_LENGTH_ | 50,000,123 | 50,000,123 | 50,000,123 | 50,000,123 | 50,000,123  
_BYTE_SIZE_OF_THIS_CHUNK_ | 10,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 10,000,123  
_FIRST_BYTE_ | 0 | 10,000,000 | 20,000,000 | 30,000,000 | 40,000,000  
_LAST_BYTE_ | 9,999,999 | 19,999,999 | 29,999,999 | 39,999,999 | 50,000,122  
_BINARY_FILE_DATA_ | BINARY1 | BINARY2 | BINARY3 | BINARY4 | BINARY5  
response HTTP status | 206 | 206 | 206 | 206 | 201  
The following is the corresponding `source_info` for [initializing video upload](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-upload-video#initialize_video_upload).

"source_info": {
"source": "FILE_UPLOAD",
"video_size": 50000123"chunk_size":  10000000"total_chunk_count": 5  }
```
##### Whole upload
In this example, the media file is 4 MB, which must be uploaded as a whole in one request.
**Variable** | **Single Request**  
---|---  
_UPLOAD_URL_ | https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=123&upload_token=wholeexample

"video_size": 4194304"chunk_size":  4194304"total_chunk_count": 1  }
```
#### Response
**HTTP Code** | **Status** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
201   
|  Created   
|  All parts are uploaded. TikTok will start the posting process.   
206 |  PartialContent   
| The current chunk has been successfully processed. There are additional chunks yet to be uploaded.  
400 |  BadRequest   
| Malformated request headers, or _BYTE_SIZE_OF_THIS_CHUNK_  
403 | Forbidden | The `upload_url` has expired.  
404 | NotFound | TikTok cannot find a valid upload task given the `upload_url`.  
416   
|  RequestedRangeNotSatisfiable   
| `Content-Range` does not reflect the actual upload progress.  
5xx   
|  InternalServerError   
| Gateway connection error or TikTok Internal error. You should retry submitting this chunk.  
The response header includes the following key-value pair indicating the number of bytes uploaded:
`Content-Range:bytes 0-{UPLOADED_BYTES}/{TOTAL_BYTE_LENGTH}`.
## Pull from URL
By initializing your content post using /init endpoints with `source=PULL_FROM_URL`, the TikTok server starts to download the media resource using the URL you provide. Learn more about [getting post status.](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-get-video-status)
TikTok server's ingress bandwidth for file downloads can reach 100 Mbps.
### Prerequisites
  * Ensure that the media URL you provided belongs to a path that you own. To confirm ownership, log into the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/) and add your Domain or URL Prefix property to your application in the URL properties widget as shown below. You must have manage or write access to the property.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/60c69aa13982332ea628cdbb3fec30bb)
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/69b8cc19584034b417d927714b0db14d)
  * The media URL must use "https" and should not redirect to another URL.
  * The URL must remain accessible for the entire duration of the download process, which times out one hour after the download task is initiated.
**Note:** To conveniently test the Pull from URL feature, you can try 
### Ownership verification rules
#### Domain
##### Definition
A domain can be a base domain (for example, example.com) or a subdomain (for example, subdomain.example.com).
##### Verification
To verify domain ownership, it is recommended that you add a signature string to the domain's DNS records.
Once the ownership of a domain is verified, all paths under that domain or its subdomains are considered owned by the developer application.
For example, if you have verified the domain `static.example.com`, then URLs like `https://video.static.example.com/tiktok/example.mp4` are considered verified, while URLs like `https://example.com/videos/example.mp4` are still considered unverified.
#### URL Prefix
##### Definition
A URL prefix consists of: https:// + host + path + /.
The host must be a domain and should not be an IP address.
Redirections are not followed. URLs that return HTTP 3xx are considered invalid.
##### Verification
Once a URL prefix's ownership is verified, all URLs with the exact prefix are considered owned by the developer application.
For example, if you have already verified the domain `https://example.com/videos/user/`, then URLs like `https://example.com/videos/user/123/example.mp4` are considered verified, while URLs like `https://example.com/videos/2023/user/123/example.mp4` are still considered unverified.
## Cancel ongoing pull from URL tasks
The API can cancel downloads for both Direct Post and Content Upload endpoints on a _best-effort_ basis.
While it is possible to cancel ongoing slow downloads, it is not feasible to cancel downloads that are nearing completion or already in the file processing state.
## Request
```

# Direct Post
## Overview
To directly post a video to users' TikTok accounts, you must invoke the Content Posting API - Direct Post endpoint to perform the following actions:
  1. Query creator information to render the UI elements to be displayed on the Export page of your app. 
    1. Learn more about [the UX guidelines here.](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-sharing-guidelines)
    2. Learn more about the [creator_info/query API here](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-query-creator-info).
  2. Initialize the post request.
  3. Export the video to TikTok servers.
This guide contains comprehensive information about the API, including the endpoint, request schema, and response schema.
**Note:** All content posted by unaudited clients will be restricted to private viewing mode. Once you have successfully tested your integration, to lift the restriction on content visibility, your API client must [undergo an audit](https://developers.tiktok.com/application/content-posting-api) to verify compliance with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/tik-tok-developer-terms-of-service?lang=en).
## Initialize the posting request
Once you have [requested creator info](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-query-creator-info), and users have provided the necessary metadata for their posts and given explicit consent to send their video to TikTok, the next step is to initialize the posting request.

# Get Post Status
For content uploaded with the Content Posting API, two mechanisms are provided for developers to check the status of the post by the TikTok user:
  1. Fetch Status endpoint: An API endpoint for polling the status of the post.
  2. Content Posting webhooks: Events that notify your registered endpoint of the final outcome of the post.
## Content Status Overview
Content uploaded to TikTok undergoes several stages before it is published. This process can be visualized with the following diagram:
  * Direct Post:
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/b82595c59145b8e29fffbcbb2192b747)
  * Content Upload
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/c66a0683c210612970f5f683c80cfb0d)
The time taken in any given stage can vary by use cases and a time limit is not guaranteed for the content posting process. The following are some helpful details:
  * The average processing times for content processing vary by content size:
    * 512 MB: Less than half a minute
    * 1 GB: About one minute
    * 4 GB: More than two minutes
  * If the post was created for **public** viewership, it must undergo TikTok's moderation process. Based on TikTok's policies, developers are not provided with the `post_id` until this process is complete.
    * Moderation usually finishes within one minute.
    * In some cases, moderation may take a few hours.

Once you have initialized the video upload and received an `upload_url`, you must send the video file to TikTok for processing. Many video formats are supported and chunking is provided for larger files. Learn more about [media transmission](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-media-transfer-guide).

                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-sharing-guidelines?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# General Guidelines
## Watermark Guidelines
We expect you to avoid adding unwanted material to content posted to TikTok. That means your apps and integrations should not superimpose or otherwise include any brand name, logo, watermark, other promotional branding, link or promotional text, on or in any content which is shared to TikTok. Doing so is a violation of these guidelines, and may also lead to deleted content or disabled accounts.
## Direct Post API - Developer Guidelines
Direct Post API enables developers to build "Share to TikTok" experiences in their app, which allows creators to share content directly to their TikTok profile. As a developer, you can use this API in an unverified status, but all content uploaded via this endpoint will be restricted to private viewing mode. To lift this restriction, your API client must [undergo an audit](https://developers.tiktok.com/application/content-posting-api) to verify compliance with our [Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/tik-tok-developer-terms-of-service?lang=en). 
If your API client has not been audited, the following restrictions will apply:
  * **User cap** : Unaudited API Clients can allow up to 5 users to post in a 24 hour window. All user accounts using the API client to post must be set to private at the time of posting.
  * **Private Viewership** : Unaudited API Clients can only post contents in `SELF_ONLY` viewership. To make the contents publicly viewable later on, the account owner must first change their account visibility to public, and then change the privacy settings of each content to "Everyone."
Additionally, both audited and unaudited API clients will be subject to the following caps:
  * **Creator cap** : There will be a 24-hour active creator cap for each API client based on the usage estimates provided in the audit application form.
  * **Posting cap** : There is a limit on the number of posts that can be made to a creator account in a 24-hour window via Direct Post API. The upper limit may vary among creators (typically around 15 posts per day/ creator account) and is shared across all API Clients using Direct Post.
### Intended Use
1) API Clients should facilitate authentic creators to post original content to TikTok.
Not acceptable: An app that copies arbitrary contents from other platforms to TikTok. ❌
2) API Clients must not be limited to test applications and should be intended for a wide audience, not limited to internal groups/private use.
Not acceptable: A utility tool to help upload contents to the account(s) you or your team manages. ❌
### Required UX Implementation in Your App
**1) API Clients must retrieve the latest creator info when rendering the Post to TikTok page.**
a. The upload page must display the creator's nickname, so users are aware of which TikTok account the content will be uploaded to.
b. When the _creator_info API_ returns that the creator can not make more posts at this moment, API Clients must stop the current publishing attempt and prompt users to try again later.
c. When posting a video, API clients must check if the duration of the to-be-posted video follows the `max_video_post_duration_sec` returned in the _creator_info API_.
**2) API Clients must allow users to enter or select the following metadata for a post:**
a. Title
b. Privacy Status, with the following mandatory requirements:
  * The options listed in the UX must follow the `privacy_level_options` returned in the _creator_info API_.
  * Users must manually select the privacy status from a dropdown and there should be no default value.
c. Interaction Ability - Allow Comment, Duet, and Stitch - with the following style requirements:
  * If the creator_info API returns that one or more of these interactions have been disabled in their app settings, your UX must disable and grey out the checkbox for the interaction.
  * Users must manually turn on these interaction settings and none should be checked by default.
  * Duet and Stitch features are not applicable to photo posts. So, for Photo Posts, only 'Allow Comment' can be displayed in the UX.
NOTE: Before allowing users to post through your platform, there should be a declaration asking for a user's consent before the publish button. It should clearly state: "By posting, you agree to TikTok's [Music Usage Confirmation](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/music-usage-confirmation/en)"
**3) API Clients must allow users to disclose Commercial Content:**
a. **Content Disclosure Setting** - Indicate whether this content promotes yourself, a brand, product or service, with this feature `turned off` by default. Enabling this feature will display checkboxes for "Your brand" and "Branded content" below, allowing users to select their preferences.
  * **Your Brand** : You are promoting yourself or your own business. This content will be classified as Brand Organic. **If this option is selected by the user, a****prompt should state: "****Your photo/video will be labeled as 'Promotional content'****"**
  * **Branded Content** : You are promoting another brand or a third party. This content will be classified as Branded Content. **If this option is selected by the user, a****prompt should state: "****Your photo/video will be labeled as 'Paid partnership'****"**
  * If both the above options are selected by the user, a prompt should state "_Your photo/video will be labeled as 'Paid partnership'_ "
It is a multiple selection, and at least one of the options above must be chosen to proceed with publishing. If the commercial content disclosure toggle is `turned on` but no options are selected, the publish button should be `disabled`. To make it easier for users to follow, **hovering over will show a notification: "****You need to indicate if your content promotes yourself, a third party, or both****.****"**
b. **Privacy Management:**
  * If a user wants to choose Branded Content, it is important to **note that it can only be configured with visibility as public/friends**. 
  * If the visibility setting is chosen as "private" (only me):
    * Either the "Branded Content" option should be `disabled`, **informing the user that visibility for branded content can't be private**.
    * OR, the visibility setting should be automatically switched to public if the user wants to choose Branded Content, **informing the user about the same**.
  * Before selecting the privacy/visibility setting, if a user has `turned on` the commercial content disclosure toggle and checked the branded content option, then the "only me" permission should be `disabled`, and **hovering over it will display a prompt stating, "Branded content visibility cannot be set to private."**
**4) Compliance requirements:**
If the user is trying to post commercial content (i.e. commercial content toggle is `turned on`):
  * When only "Your Brand" is checked, the declaration should be the same as mentioned above: "By posting, you agree to TikTok's [Music Usage Confirmation](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/music-usage-confirmation/en)."
  * When only "Branded Content" is checked, the declaration should be changed to: "By posting, you agree to TikTok's [Branded Content Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/bc-policy/en) and [Music Usage Confirmation.](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/music-usage-confirmation/en)"
  * Additionally, when both options are selected, the declaration should be: "By posting, you agree to TikTok's [Branded Content Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/bc-policy/en) and [Music Usage Confirmation](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/music-usage-confirmation/en)."

**5) The users of API Clients must have full awareness and control of what is being posted to their TikTok accounts.**
a. API Clients should display a preview of the to-be-posted content.
b. API Clients should not add promotional watermarks/logos to creators' content. Preset text, including any text in the title field or hashtags, should be allowed to be edited by the user before posting content.
c. API Clients must only start sending content materials to TikTok after the user has expressly consent to the upload.
d. API Clients must clearly notify users that after they finish publishing their content, it may take a few minutes for the content to process and be visible on their profile. 
e. API clients should poll the [publish/status/fetch API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/content-posting-api-reference-get-video-status) or handle status update webhooks, so users can understand the status of their posts.
### Technical Considerations
**1) Keep client_secret confidential**
a. You must not share your API Credentials with any other third-party or embed your client_secret in open source projects.
b. Maintain appropriate technical and administrative controls to ensure the security and confidentiality of client_secret.
**2) Choose efficient means to send contents to TikTok**
a. PULL_FROM_URL should be used when API Clients already have the to-be-posted contents on server-side file storage services.
b. The supplied URL must be under the path of a domain or URL prefix API Clients have ownership on. The ownership needs to be verified through the Manage URL properties flow on the Manage Apps page in your TT4D app.
c. FILE_UPLOAD should be used when the to-be-posted video is on the users' devices (PC, Mac, Switch, etc) of API Clients.
d. If video resources are already on API Clients' servers, do not use FILE_UPLOAD; use PULL_FROM_URL instead.

| Yes  
Content-Type | string | The original media type of the resource | application/json | Yes  
###  Query parameters
**Key** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required**  
---|---|---|---|---  
fields | string |  The requested fields:
  * request_id
|  request_id   
| Yes  
###  Body
**Key** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required**  
---|---|---|---|---  
data_format |  string   
|  Format in which the individual data files will be returned. Valid values are:
  * text
  * json
| "text" | Yes  
category_selection_list   
| list<string> |  Type of data that is to be returned. See <Data Categories>.  Valid values are:
  * all_data
  * video
  * profile
  * activity
  * direct_message
|  ["profile", "activity"]   
| Yes  
####  Scopes required for categories
**Data Categories** | **Required Scopes**  
---|---  
activity | portability.activity.single, portability.activity.ongoing  
video, profile | portability.postsandprofile.single, portability.postsandprofile.ongoing  
direct_message | portability.directmessages.single, portability.directmessages.ongoing  
all_data, activity, video, profile, direct_message | portability.all.single, portability.all.ongoing  
Notes:
  * If "all_data" is sent as a parameter in `category_selection_list`, it will take precedence over other categories.
  * For any `portability.*.single` scope, **Add Data Request** can only be called once to create a new request.
  * For cases where multiple `portability.*.single` scopes are authorized by the user:
Example: 
If scopes `portability.all.single` and `portability.activity.single` are authorized by the user and a request with `"category_selection_list" : ["activity", "video"]` is made.
The only scope consumed will be `portability.all.single`, as it has access to all the categories.
After making the request, the current access token will contain the scope `portability.activity.single` and a new request for the category `activity` can be made after the current request is fulfilled without reauthorizing the access token from the user.
###  Request Example
```
curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/user/data/add/?fields=request_id' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.testTemp123testtemp123.e1' \

                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-api-download?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# Download
Use POST request to download the requested data. The response is streamed as an HTTP data zip file.
**HTTP URL** | https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/user/data/download/  
---|---  
**HTTP Method** | POST  
**Scopes** |  portability.all.single, portability.all.ongoing, portability.activity.single, portability.activity.ongoing, portability.directmessages.single, portability.directmessages.ongoing, portability.postsandprofile.single, portability.postsandprofile.ongoing,  
### Headers
**Key** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Authorization | string | The token that bears the authorization of the TikTok user, which is obtained through /v2/oauth/token/ |  Bearer clt.example12345Example12345Example   
### Body
**Key** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required**  
---|---|---|---|---  
request_id | int64 | The unique ID generated to track the download data request. This value can be obtained from the Add Data Request API. |  123123123123   
| Yes  
## Response
The response is streamed as HTTP zip file, and must be converted to a zip file to get the correct data.
This Python script can be used to POST a successful request and get data in a readable format
```
import requests
import json
url = "https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/user/data/download/"# The request_id returned from the `Add Data Request` APIrequest_id = <REQUEST ID>
# Request JSON structurepayload = json.dumps({
"request_id": request_id
})
# Necessary headers# Authorization must have the token obtained from the /v2/oauth/token/ APIheaders = {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
'Authorization': 'AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN'}
response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
zip_file_path = f'./{request_id}.zip'# Open the zip file in write-binary modewithopen(zip_file_path, 'wb') as zip_file:
# Write the content of the response to the zip file    zip_file.write(response.content)
```
### Success Example
`.zip` must be added to streamed data to make it a zip file. The data itself, viewed as unicode will not be human-readable. 
### Failure Example
In case a Download Request is unsuccessful, the following response will be returned
```
{
"data": {},
"error": {
"code": "invalid_params",
"http_status_code": 400,
"log_id": "20240125230933D4C4606E87F0A61BE502",
"message": "Incorrect `request_id`. Please validate the request."    }
}

# Data Portability FAQ 
### General
  1. **Why do I need to fill out the Data Portability API Application form?**
TikTok needs to assess each application to ensure that requests are valid and are made by genuine companies or services. This is to ensure the privacy and security of user data. 
  1. **How does the Data Portability API Application differ from App Review?**
The Data Portability API is a functionality that developers can add to their apps. To protect user data privacy, developers must complete an application form and receive approval. App Review is a separate review of the developer app itself, to ensure that the app is eligible to integrate with our services. Learn more about the [App Review process](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/our-guidelines-developer-guidelines/). 
### Data Portability API Application 
  1. **What languages do you support on the application?**
Please submit your entire application in English, including the UX mockups and any other uploads. 
  1. **Can I apply for the Data Portability API before I submit my app or website for review?**
Yes, you can submit an application for the Data Portability API while your app is in Draft status.
  1. **What if I cannot supply all the information being requested?**
You must complete all required fields to submit your application. 
  1. **What happens after I submit my application?**
TikTok will review your application, which may take 3 to 4 weeks from the application submission date. You will receive a notification email after your application is processed. 
  1. **Will a TikTok representative contact me about my application?**
A TikTok representative will assess your application, and if applicable, may reach out to request follow-up information with the email that you provide on your application form. 
  1. **What happens if I am not approved?**
If you are not approved, you can reapply at any time. Click the **View scopes** button under the **Data Portability API** product on the app page to access the application form. 
  1. **What should I do if I made a mistake or need to resubmit my application?**
Please submit a [support ticket](https://developers.tiktok.com/support/) and select **Data Portability API** as the **Topic**.
  1. **What happens after I go live with Data Portability API?**
TikTok reserves the right to periodically check that your application continues to match your app or website, and may revoke access if application terms are breached.
  1. **What are the daily quota limits? Can I request an increase in the quota limit?**
Currently, the daily limit is set at 1000 requests per minute, allowing you to make up to 1000 requests of any given type per minute for the Data Portability API.
If you believe a quota limit increase is necessary for your application, please contact us via [Support](https://developers.tiktok.com/support/) and we'll take your request into consideration.
  1. **Can I get a copy of my application?**
We are unable to supply a copy of your application and recommend that you make your own copy of the information that you provide for your reference.

                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-api-get-started?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# Get Started
This guide will show you how to apply for the Data Portability API and what you need to become fully integrated and approved to use the Data Portability API functionality. 
## Prerequisites
Before you start, you will need access to the following: 
  * A TikTok developer account on the TikTok for Developers website.
  * A registered app on the TikTok for Developers website. The app must at least be in **Staging** status to generate an App ID (a numerical code that uniquely identifies your app).
  * Screenshots of detailed UX mockups showing the user flow for your app's use case.
## Apply for access
  1. Go to the **Manage apps** page and select your app, or **Connect an app** if you don't have one yet.
  2. On the app page, click the **Add products** button under **Products** , then add **Data Portability API**.
  3. Add the **Login Kit** and **Webhooks** products to your app as well. 
  4. On the **Data Portability API** product, view scopes, then click **Apply** to access the application for Data Portability API.
  5. Fill out the **Data Portability API Application** form and submit. Make sure to select all necessary scopes on the form. 
    1. Wait for approval. You can typically expect to hear back within 3-4 weeks. You can check for scope approval status on the app page. 
    2. Once you have received approval, you can choose which approved scopes to add to your app on the **Data Portability API** product. 
  6. Fill out the information on the app page, including under **Login Kit** and **Webhooks**.
  7. Click **Submit for review** , and we will start reviewing your app.
NOTE: You may submit your app for review before your Data Portability API Application is processed.
Once you are approved for Login Kit, Webhooks, and the Data Portability API scopes, you can start using the Data Portability API functionality for your app. 
## Get permission
All the scopes for calling Data Portability APIs are in the form `portability.`**< data type>**`.single` and `portability.`**< data type>**`.ongoing`
With **< data type>** being: `all`, `activity`, `directmessages`, and `postsandprofile`. There are eight available scopes, as described below. 
All data
  * portability.all.single: Make a single request for all available data on the user's behalf
  * portability.all.ongoing: Make ongoing requests for all available data on the user's behalf
Posts and profile
  * portability.postsandprofile.single: Make a single request for posts and profile data on the user's behalf
  * portability.postsandprofile.ongoing: Make ongoing requests for posts and profile data on the user's behalf
Activity
  * portability.activity.single: Make a single request for activity data on the user's behalf
  * portability.activity.ongoing: Make ongoing requests for activity data on the user's behalf
Direct messages
  * portability.directmessages.single: Make a single request for direct message data on the user's behalf
  * portability.directmessages.ongoing: Make ongoing requests for direct message data on the user's behalf
NOTE: Subsequent requests made using ongoing permission (or made with multiple one-time authorizations) will return the full data for the given scope. 
You can visit the [Data Types](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-data-types/) page to see more detail about what information is included for each scope. 
## Lifecycle of a data request
Once authorized, making a data request for a given user involves a few steps:
  1. Request data
    1. Use the [Add Data Request](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-api-add-data-request/) endpoint to start a data export. In your request, you should indicate the categories of data you're requesting (all_data, activity, video, profile, direct_message), which the user should have authorized permission for. If they haven't authorized permission, the response will include an error.
  2. (If desired) Check the status of an ongoing request
    1. Use the [Check Status of Data Request](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-api-check-status-of-data-request/) endpoint to see the status of an ongoing request.
  3. (If desired) Cancel an ongoing request
    1. Use the [Cancel Data Request](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-api-cancel-data-request/) endpoint to cancel a request. If the user has allowed you to make ongoing requests, you can make another request using the same token.
  4. Once a request is ready, we'll send notice to the callback URL you provided in the app page via [webhook](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/webhooks-events/). We aim to provide data within a few seconds, minutes, or hours, depending on the data requested. However, this is not guaranteed, as unforeseen technical issues may cause delays.
  5. Once you receive the callback, you can [download the data](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-api-download/) with a Download request. Data will be available to download for four days after it's been prepared.
NOTE: You are not required to set up webhooks to receive notifications. Instead, you can check the status of the request and download the data once it is ready.

## Overview
TikTok's Data Portability API allows users to designate your app to receive one-time or ongoing transfers of their data. Your app can request transfers of a user's full data archive to enable backup and synchronizing use cases, or request specific categories of data. This page will document the data types included in the exports, including an overview of the fields included in a full export. 
If you have any feedback on the categories of data provided by the Data Portability API, you can [contact support](https://developers.tiktok.com/support).
## Categories of Data
Your app can request permission to transfer specific categories of data, or export the user's full data archive. 
### Posts and Profile

  * A user's profile information, including their follower and following list 
  * The posts they've made on TikTok

# Get Started
This guide will show you how to get an authorization code and an access token in order to utilize the Display APIs. We will use the Display APIs to display a TikTok user's profile and videos on your platform.
## Before You Start
You will need access to:
  * A TikTok developer account on TikTok Developer Portal
  * Approval for both a Login Kit and TikTok API products
  * Granted `user.info``.basic` and `video.list` scopes for your app
  * A TikTok account with a few posted videos
## Authorization
### Get an Authorization Code
Follow these documents to integrate with our login kit, and use your TikTok account to authorize and get an access token. You will need to set scope=user.info.basic,video.list.
  * [iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-ios-quickstart)
  * [Android](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-android-quickstart-v2)
  * [Web](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-web/)
After following one of the tutorials to get user authorization, you will be able to get an authorization code that looks like the following: 
`wFPH5DePZMb07BPJvpWi-WotFlq1ISzFYQBDb9S9CBUQkGZRGW3zOAbYzhGXkoYkFx-aDeph0hTFk3l6ngGYuoixRvvZBWV1e3Q_BFoBELY*0!6410`
### Get an Access Token
Follow this [tutorial](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens/) to use the authorization code to retrieve the user's access token and open id. 
```
{
"data": {
"access_token": "act.example12345Example12345Example",
"captcha": "",
"desc_url": "",
"description": "",
"error_code": 0,
"expires_in": 86400,
"log_id": "20220714041044010002007735002037040BAF34",
"open_id": "abcdefgh-1a2b-123c4-ab12-abc123abc1234",
"refresh_expires_in": 31536000,
"refresh_token": "rft.example12345Example12345Example",
"scope": "user.info.basic"    },
"message": "success"}
```
## Display User's TikTok Profile
  1. Design and build a UI to host the TikTok account profile.
  2. Call **[GET /v2/user/info/](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-get-user-info)** API using access_token to get user profile information.
Example request:
```
curl -L -X GET 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/user/info/?fields=open_id,union_id,avatar_url,display_name' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example'
```
Example response:
```
{
"data":{
"user":{
"avatar_url":"https://p19-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast5-avt-0068-tx/b17f0e4b3a4f4a50993cf72cda8b88b8~c5_168x168.jpeg",
"open_id":"723f24d7-e717-40f8-a2b6-cb8464cd23b4",
"union_id":"c9c60f44-a68e-4f5d-84dd-ce22faeb0ba1",
"display_name": "Tik Toker"      }
   },
"error":{
"code":"ok",
"message":"",
"log_id":"20220829194722CBE87ED59D524E727021"   }
}
```
  1. Parse the returned profile information and display it in your UI.
## Display User's Recent TikTok Videos
  1. Design and build your interface to encourage users to authorize displaying their most recent TikTok videos on your platform. 
  2. Call **[POST /v2/video/list/](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-video-list)** using the access token to get a list of a specified user's most recent videos. The returned videos are sorted by their creation time in descending order. 
```
curl -L -X POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/video/list/?fields=id,title,video_description,duration,cover_image_url,embed_link' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

  1. Use the URLs in `embed_link` to open webviews and display videos as needed.
  2. Schedule background jobs to keep the access token up-to-date using Refresh Token. This will fetch and update the user's recent TikTok videos every 12 hours.
## Display User's Self-Selected TikTok Videos
Design and build a UI to encourage users to bring their TikTok videos to your platform.
  1. Call **[POST /v2/video/list/](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-video-list)** using an access token to get a list of user's videos. This part is the same as displaying a user's recent TikTok videos.
  2. Design the UI to display the videos with `cover_image_url` and `duration`. 
  3. Allow the user to select videos to add to your app. After they complete their selection, save the metadata of the user's selected videos. Design the UI to present user's TikTok videos.
  4. The `cover_image_url` will expire after some time, so we need to call **[POST /v2/video/query/](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-video-query)**
```
curl -L -X POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/video/query/?fields=id,cover_image_url,embed_link' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \

  1. Open a web view with the url `embed_link` to consume the video on user clicks. Users can now view TikTok videos on your platform to know more about the author.

# Overview
The Display API contains a set of HTTP-based APIs that your product can use to display a TikTok creator's videos and their profile information.
Your platform's influencers can display their TikTok profile identities and videos to enrich content, attract more audiences, and enable their followers to view their TikTok videos without leaving your platform.
## Components
Display API has three major APIs: `/v2/user/info/`, `/v2/video/list/`, and `/v2/video/query/`. 
**[/v2/user/info/](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-get-user-info)****:** Get a TikTok user's basic profile information. This includes the user's open_id, avatar_url, display_name, profile_deep_link, and bio_description.
**[/v2/video/list/](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-video-list)****:** Get the metadata of a TikTok user's recently uploaded videos. 
**[/v2/video/query/](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-video-query)****:** Get the metadata of TikTok a user's videos filtered by video Id.
## Permissions
  * **video.list:** Read a user's public videos on TikTok.
  * **user.info****.basic:** Read a user's profile info (open id, avatar, display name, ...).
## Example Use Cases
### Display User's TikTok Profile
Use the /v2/user/info/ API to get a TikTok user's profile data and then display their TikTok identity. In this example, when a visitor clicks the profile_deep_link, they will be redirected to the creator's profile page on the TikTok app or website.

### Display User's Self-Selected TikTok Videos
Use the /v2/video/list/ and /v2/video/query/ APIs to get the metadata of a TikTok user's videos and integrate an embedded video player into your product. In addition, you can design features to allow users to select their TikTok videos to present on their profile and enable their followers to watch the video in webview.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/fe807d250ee00c33d54a286eda148750)
### Display User's Recent TikTok Videos
Use the /v2/video/list/ and /v2/video/query/ APIs to get the metadata of a TikTok user's videos and integrate an embedded video player into your product. In addition, you can design features to allow users to show their recent TikTok videos on your platform.

# Introduction
Creator Profile Embed allows TikTok creator profiles to be embedded into your articles or websites. With this tool you can showcase an overview of a creator's presence on TikTok, including the number of users who follow that creator, the number of users that creator follows, and the number of likes that creator has received across all of their TikTok videos. The embedded creator profile also contains a selection of up to ten of the creator's most recent videos. Like [embedded videos](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/embed-videos), most of the components in an embedded creator profile link back to the corresponding pages on [TikTok.com](https://www.tiktok.com) or the app.
## Private and underage accounts
Private accounts and underage accounts cannot be embedded. In these cases, the share icon will be grayed out and won't be interactive. Accounts which are later set as "private" on TikTok will be shown as private on the embed profile card as well, as are underage accounts. Users who have not yet set their age in their TikTok profile are shown as private by default.
## Embed from TikTok.com
You can get the embed code by visiting the creator's profile page on [TikTok.com](https://www.tiktok.com). Click the share icon and select "Embed" from the dropdown. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/d42291920a28d7a544311b5a4138f29a)
See [https://www.tiktok.com/@scout2015](https://www.tiktok.com/@scout2015) to see this embed workflow
Once you have clicked on this button, a popup card will appear with the embed code. Click "Copy code" to copy the entire embed code to your clipboard and paste it where you wish to display the creator profile card. The embedded profile card will automatically show up on your page.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/2c6324e7ef2ce450f67761a336f86975)
Creator Profile Embed can support a wide variety of screens. Videos will automatically play when moused over on desktop or when on-screen on mobile and can be scrolled to the side.
- | Autoplay | Scroll  
---|---|---  
Mobile | Whenever on-screen | Yes - tap and scroll  
Desktop | On mouseover | Yes - mouse scroll, scrollbar  
Desktop | Mobile

Most of the components on the embedded creator profile are interactive. By clicking or tapping on them, the user will be linked directly to the corresponding content page on [TikTok.com](https://www.tiktok.com) or the app. The "Open TikTok" button at the bottom of the embedded profile card will link users to the creator’s profile page, as will the avatar, username, metrics, and user description. Video cards contained within the embedded creator profile link to their respective videos in the webpage or the app. 
The same moderation standards apply to both in-app and embedded content. For example, if a video has been removed from the TikTok app, the same video in its embedded form on the web will no longer be accessible.
> Note: Some browsers in China will forbid the use of TikTok's custom player and show the default player provided by the browser.
## Embed for developers
Programmatically, you may convert a TikTok creator profile URL into embedded markup by using the oEmbed API. It allows you to get the embed code and additional information about the creator profile associated with the webpage link provided.
### API

# Embed Player
## Introduction
This embedded player consists of a TikTok post hosted inside of an inline frame (iframe) element. This player allows you to do the following: 
  * Customize the player by appending query parameters in the iframe URL. For example, you can display the music information of this video using the "description" parameter, or you can hide the video controls using the "controls" parameter. 
  * Control the player by messaging the HTML host to enable functionality like playing, pausing, muting, and more. 
See more on the custom options and messaging communication below. 
## Get started
First locate the TikTok post you want to embed in the player. The post URL follows this structure: www.tiktok.com/player/v1/{tiktok_post_id}.
View the following example: [https://www.tiktok.com/player/v1/6718335390845095173](https://www.tiktok.com/player/v1/6718335390845095173)
You can find the TikTok post ID on from the post URL. For example, 6718335390845095173 is the post ID from the URL [https://www.tiktok.com/@scout2015/video/6718335390845095173](https://www.tiktok.com/@scout2015/video/6718335390845095173)  
## Customize the player 
You can customize the player by choosing which playback interface elements should be hidden or displayed. 
For example, this URL displays the TikTok post's music info and the description: [https://www.tiktok.com/player/v1/6718335390845095173?music_info=1&description=1](https://www.tiktok.com/player/v1/6718335390845095173?music_info=1&description=1)

# Introduction
Embedded Videos enable TikTok videos to be embedded into your articles or websites. This helps to foster storytelling, and provides proper attribution by showing the video creator, video description and background sound in the form of TikTok's custom player. It also links back to the corresponding content on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com).
## Embed from TikTok.com
Follow these steps to get the embed code from a TikTok video:
  1. Open the video webpage on [tiktok.com](https://www.tiktok.com)
     * [Example video webpage](https://www.tiktok.com/@scout2015/video/6718335390845095173)
     * You must open this webpage in the browser from a non-mobile surface
  2. Click the Share button (right-facing arrow icon), and then click Embed 
  3. From the popup window, simply copy and paste the code into the destination webpage, where you wish to attach the video. Voilà, the embedded video will automatically load on the page.
Embedded videos support volume control during playback and provide recommended videos at the end of each playback.
All buttons and texts on the embedded video are interactive. By tapping on them, the user will be linked directly to the corresponding content page on [tiktok.com](https://www.tiktok.com). The "Discover more on TikTok" button at the bottom of the embedded card will either link users to the [Trending Page](https://www.tiktok.com/trending) if the user is browsing on desktop, or deeplink users to the TikTok product page on the App Store / Google Play if browsing on a mobile device.
A video's availability is consistent in and outside the TikTok app, as moderation standards and results are applied to both in-app content and embedded content. For example, if a video has been removed from the TikTok app, the same video in its embedded form on the web will no longer be accessible.
> Note: Some browsers in CN will forbid the use of TikTok's custom player and show the default player provided by the browser.
## Embedded for developers
Programmatically, you may convert a TikTok's video URL into embedded video markup by using the oEmbed API. It allows you to get the embed code and additional information about the video associated with the webpage link provided.
### API
GET | /oembed | Returns the embed code and information about the video  
---|---|---  
### Parameters
**Request**
Param | Description  
---|---  
url | The video link for embedding  
**Response**
The response format follows the specification of 
```
https://www.tiktok.com/oembed?url=https://www.tiktok.com/@scout2015/video/6718335390845095173
```

# Android Quickstart
Integrating our open SDK can help you leverage TikTok's open platform capabilities, such as Login Kit, Sound Kit, sharing videos to TikTok, and more coming soon. We hope to help you enhance your app's discovery and engagement, as well as provide another location for your users to share their favorite content for the world to see.
## Getting started
Below is a quick start for you to apply the TikTok SDK to your application. You should confirm that your project has a **Minimum****API****level of 16: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)** or higher.
### Step 1: Configure TikTok App Settings for Android
Use the Developer Portal to apply for Android client_key and client_secret access. Upon application approval, the Developer Portal will provide access to these keys.
### Step 2: Install the SDK and Setup Android Project
  1. In Project window, switch to "Android" view tab and open Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Project). Then add the following repository in the repositories{} section. For example:
```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://artifact.bytedance.com/repository/AwemeOpenSDK" }
}
```
  1. Open Gradle Scripts > build.gradle (Module: app) and add the following implementation statement to the dependencies{} section:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.bytedance.ies.ugc.aweme:opensdk-oversea-external:0.2.1.2'
}
```
  1. Edit your Application
First you need to initialize `TikTokOpenApiFactory` by using client key in your custom Application.
```
@OverridepublicvoidonCreate(){
super.onCreate();
    String clientKey = "[CLIENT_KEY]";
    TikTokOpenConfig tiktokOpenConfig = new TikTokOpenConfig(clientKey);
    TikTokOpenApiFactory.init(new TikTokOpenConfig(tiktokOpenConfig));
}
```
  1. Edit Your Manifest
  * Open the **/app/manifest/AndroidManifest.xml** file.
  * Register `TikTokEntryActivity` for receiving callbacks in Manifest. If you have customized an activity to receive callbacks, you may skip this step.
```
// If you have customized activity to receive callbacks, you can skip the step<activity
    android:name=".tiktokapi.TikTokEntryActivity"    android:exported="true">
</activity>
```
> Note:
>   * Due to changes in Android 11 regarding package visibility, when impementing Tiktok SDK for devices targeting Android 11 and higher, add the following to the Android Manifest file:
> 
```
<queries>
    <package android:name="com.zhiliaoapp.musically" />
    <package android:name="com.ss.android.ugc.trill" />
</queries>
```
  1. Excellent! Now, **sync** your project and get the latest version of SDK package.
At this point, you should already set up the basic development environment. Next please refer to the feature access doc for further integrating.

## Verify URL ownership
Note: For Sandbox environments, URL verification is only required for Content Posting API. 
Before submitting your app for review, you must verify URL properties for all URLs in your app configuration. Some features require URL verification before they can be used, like Link Sharing (beta). There are two cases for URL verification, depending on when the app was created. 
  * For apps created after September 9, 2024, the following URLs require verification:
    * Terms of Service URL
    * Privacy Policy URL
    * Web or Desktop URL
  * All apps that use the Content Posting API upload URL or the Link Sharing URL must verify these URLs, regardless of when the app was created.
To verify URL properties, complete the following steps:
  1. Click the **URL properties** button at the top of your app page. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/3fce2de336142aa54a1a2f17fb562922)
  1. Ensure you are verifying properties for your app in **Production** mode, then click **Verify properties**.
  2. Choose whether to verify your URL by **Domain** or **URL prefix** :
    1. For verification by Domain, enter your domain and subdomain name, then click **Verify**. 
    2. For verification by URL prefix, enter your complete URL, then click **Verify**. Download the provided signature file, then upload it to your URL.

# App Review FAQ
The first step to obtain access to our developer tools is to submit an app for review with your TikTok for Developers account. Our team reviews all applications and will either approve them or provide feedback with suggested updates. Please note that you will not have access to the APIs until your application has been approved. This page covers some frequently asked questions about the app review process.
## Frequently asked questions about app review
### How long does the app review process take?
App review may take several days to two weeks after submission. If your app is not approved, contact us through our [Support page](https://developers.tiktok.com/support/) for further guidance.
### What are the minimum requirements for submitting my app for approval?
All app review criteria are stated in the [app review guidelines](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/app-review-guidelines). 
### Does my mobile app need to be live on an app store?
  1. If you have a mobile app, it must be available in the Apple and/or Google Play App Stores. 
  2. If you have a web application and are applying for Login Kit access, you must provide a valid redirect URI.
### What are the scopes that I can apply for?
Visit our [scopes documentation](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview) to learn more about available permissions.
### What should I put in the "Submit for review" text box?
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/82b82ee821d23d424320bfd8c7af8571)
Explain how your app utilizes the TikTok for Developers APIs, for example: 
  * "We would like to enable users to quickly and securely sign into our app with their TikTok account"
  * "We would like to add a "Share to TikTok" button to our app so our users can share their videos to TikTok"
### How can I track the status of my application?
On the app page, you can view the status of your application under **Production** in the left navigation panel. 
  * **Draft** : Your app has not been submitted for review yet.
  * **In review:** Your app has been submitted for review and approval is pending. No further changes can be made at this stage.
  * **Live:** Your current revision of the app was approved and integrations are live.
  * **Not approved:** After reviewing your app, we determined it did not meet our criteria. Click the history icon button at the top of the app page to access **Review comments**. Complete the suggested actions and resubmit your app for review.
### Why was my app not approved?
Apps are not approved for various reasons. Please review the application feedback in the **Review comments** available under your app's **History**. Once you have made edits to your application, be sure to resubmit your application. 
[Contact us](https://developers.tiktok.com/support/) if you have questions relating to the feedback.
### Is TikTok for Developers compatible with apps built in React Native?
Yes. Login Kit will work with web and React Native builds for Android and iOS apps. The same applies to all of our developer tools.
### How can I get access to the APIs?
For each app, a TikTok for Developer application must be submitted to request API access. Please review our [application criteria](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/app-review-guidelines) before applying. Once your application has been reviewed by our team and approved, your app status will show as Live and your app will have access to the products and scopes requested in the application. 
### How can I test the APIs for my app that is still in development?
Beta or development versions, incomplete apps, and test versions are not encouraged and will not be approved for integration with TikTok in most cases to safeguard the user experience.
If you are launching a new app and would like to integrate with TikTok from the beginning, you are expected to undergo an audit and provide additional supporting information such as reasoning and your UX mockups. We reserve the right to reject or approve such unpublished apps in our sole discretion based on the app's credibility, benefits to TikTok users, and other factors. To start this process, apply for integration assessment for unreleased apps.
### What APIs offer Marketing and Ad Campaigns?
TikTok for Developers products do not offer these functionalities. TikTok for Business offers Marketing and Ad Campaign APIs. Visit the [TikTok for Business website](https://getstarted.tiktok.com/ttvalue?attr_source=google&attr_medium=search-br-ad&attr_adgroup_id=131664210937&attr_term=tiktok%20for%20business&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4Y-sBhC6ARIsAGXF1g7-Vas1empg2j8UFkDX0Xv_LLhKuodyZc85w2zqsKywdEekKCjEws0aAvtVEALw_wcB&lang=en-US) for a list of their products.
### Can I increase my active user cap?
Please contact us via our [Support form](https://developers.tiktok.com/support/) to request an increase in your active user cap. Please note that your app must be in production to request and increase, and not all requests will be approved. 
### Can I request an infinite user access token?
User Access Tokens can be extended to a maximum of one year. For more information on how to change user access token lengths, please refer to the documentation on [managing user access tokens](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens). 
### Where can I get support for bugs and error messages for my app that's in production?
You may contact us via our [Support form](https://developers.tiktok.com/support/) for further help on technical issues.
### Why are my posts private using the Content Posting API?
All content posted by unaudited clients will be restricted to private viewing mode. Once you have successfully tested your integration, to lift the restrictions on content visibility, your API client must undergo an audit to verify compliance with our Terms of Service.

# iOS Quickstart Objective C
There is a new version of this SDK: [iOS Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-ios-quickstart)
Integrating our open SDK can help you leverage TikTok's open platform capabilities, such as Login Kit, Sound Kit, sharing videos to TikTok, and more coming soon. We hope to help you enhance your app's discovery and engagement, as well as provide another location for your users to share their favorite content for the world to see.
## Getting Started with the TikTok SDK for iOS
### Requirements
TikTok iOS SDK requires iOS 9.3 and Xcode 4.5 or later.
### Step 1: Configure TikTok App Settings for iOS
Go to TikTok Developer App Registration Page to create your app. After approval, you will get the Client Key and Client Secret.
### Step 2: Install the SDK
#### Via Cocoapods (Recommend)
Add the pod to your Podfile:
```
pod 'TikTokOpenSDK', '~> 5.0.15'
```
And then run:
```
pod install --repo-update
```
#### Via Manual Install
Link Framework
  1. **Copy** or **Drag** the SDKs into your Xcode Project.
Select your Project in Project Navigator. Click "+" in `TARGETS -> Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries`, and then select `TikTokOpenSDK.``xc``framework` in your Project folder to add it.
  1. Add `WebKit.framework` and `Security.framework`.
  * `WebKit.framework` - It is used to gain authorization through web-view when TikTok is not installed.
  * `Security.framework` - Encryption and decryption library. We use this framework to ensure that communications are securely transmitted.
  1. Add Link Flag `-ObjC` in `TARGETS->Build Settings->Other Linker Flags`. Make sure the letter 'O' and 'C' are capitalized.
The correct configuration is shown below:
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/35da96b1d6d78ad061aebcc4edd323ea)
### Step 3: Configure Xcode Project
#### Configure Info.plist
  1. In Xcode, right-click your project's Info.plist file and select Open As -> Source Code.
  2. Here are 3 keys need to configuration: 
    1. **LSApplicationQueriesSchemes: Use to Open TikTop App**
    2. **TikTokAppID: Use to config TikTok OpenSDK**
    3. **CFBundleURLTypes : Use TikTok App callback your App**
Insert the following XML snippet into the body of your file just before the final `</dict>` element.
```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key><array><string>tiktokopensdk</string><string>tiktoksharesdk</string><string>snssdk1180</string><string>snssdk1233</string></array><key>TikTokAppID</key><string>$TikTokAppID</string><key>CFBundleURLTypes</key><array><dict><key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key><array><string>$TikTokAppID</string></array></dict></array>
```
  1. Replace `$TikTokAppID` with your **App's Client Key**
> Note:
>   * `tiktokopensdk` is used for logging in.
>   * `tiktoksharesdk` is used for sharing.
>   * `snssdk1233`, `snssdk1180` are used to check if the TikTok application is installed.
>   * The TikTok Open SDK auto-registers your Client Key when your App launches.
> 
#### Make sure your app has access to Photo Library
Sharing pictures requires Photo Library access. Make sure a proper Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description is added in your Info.plist.
After the configuration, your Info.plist will look like the following.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/8914efeecb1d214b9e3c6773adcda3ad)
### Step 4: Connect App Delegate and/or Scene Delegate
You need to connect your `AppDelegate` class to the `TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.h`. To do this, add the following code to your `AppDelegate.m` file.
```
#import <TikTokOpenSDK/TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.h>@implementationAppDelegate- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [[TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
returnYES;
}
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(nonnullNSURL *)url options:(nonnullNSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options {
if ([[TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:options[UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsSourceApplicationKey] annotation:options[UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsAnnotationKey]]
        ) {
returnYES;
    }
returnNO;
}
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
{
if ([[TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation]) {
returnYES;
    }
returnNO;
}
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url
{
if ([[TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application openURL:url sourceApplication:nil annotation:nil]) {
returnYES;
    }
returnNO;
}
@end
```
If your application does not have a `SceneDelegate`, you are good to go! If your application makes use of the `SceneDelegate`, you will need to add the following code to your `SceneDelegate.m` file.
```
#import <TikTokOpenSDK/TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.h>@implementationSceneDelegate- (void)scene:(UIScene *)scene openURLContexts:(NSSet<UIOpenURLContext *> *)URLContexts
{
NSURL *url = [[URLContexts allObjects] firstObject].URL;
    [UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate application:UIApplication.sharedApplication openURL:url options:@{}];
}
@end
```
#### API Instructions
**TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate**
Log Delegate
```
@protocolTikTokOpenSDKLogDelegate <NSObject>- (void)onLog:(NSString *)logInfo;
@end
```
TikTok internal log in level ERROR or Warning will callback in this method.You need to register log delegate in TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions in the App Delegate. 
Usage:
```
[TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance].logDelegate = self;
```
Check TikTok is installed :
```
- (BOOL)isAppInstalled;
```
**BDOpenPlatformObjects**
The definition of basic classes (Request or Response) to SDK.

# iOS Quickstart Swift
There is a new version of this SDK: [iOS Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-ios-quickstart)
Integrating our open SDK can help you leverage TikTok's open platform capabilities, such as Login Kit, Sound Kit, sharing videos to TikTok, and more coming soon. We hope to help you enhance your app's discovery and engagement, as well as provide another location for your users to share their favorite content for the world to see.
     * `WebKit.framework` - It is used to gain authorization through web-view when TikTok is not installed.
     * `Security.framework` - Encryption and decryption library. We use this framework to ensure that communications are securely transmitted.
  2. Add Link Flag `-ObjC` in `TARGETS->Build Settings->Other Linker Flags`. Make sure the letter 'O' and 'C' are capitalized.
### Step 4: Connect App delegate
You need to connect your `AppDelegate` class to the `TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.h` To do this, add the following code to your `AppDelegate.m` or `AppDelegate.swift` file.
```
import TikTokOpenSDK
@mainclassAppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate{
funcapplication(_application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptionslaunchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.sharedInstance().application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
returntrue    }
funcapplication(_app: UIApplication, openurl: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
guardlet sourceApplication = options[UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey.sourceApplication] as?String,
let annotation = options[UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey.annotation] else {
returnfalse        }
ifTikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.sharedInstance().application(app, open: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation) {
returntrue        }
returnfalse    }
funcapplication(_application: UIApplication, openurl: URL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {
ifTikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.sharedInstance().application(application, open: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation) {
returntrue        }
returnfalse    }
funcapplication(_application: UIApplication, handleOpenurl: URL) -> Bool {
ifTikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.sharedInstance().application(application, open: url, sourceApplication: nil, annotation: "") {
returntrue        }
returnfalse    }
}
```
If your application does not have a `SceneDelegate`, you are good to go! If your application makes use of the `SceneDelegate`, you will need to add the following function to your `SceneDelegate` file.
```
classSceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate{
funcscene(_scene: UIScene, openURLContextsURLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {
guardlet url =URLContexts.first?.url else {
return      }
iflet appDelegate =UIApplication.shared.delegate as?AppDelegate {
_= appDelegate.application(UIApplication.shared, open: url, options: [:])
      }
  }
}
```
```
protocolTikTokOpenSDKLogDelegate{
funconLog(_logInfo: String) { }
}
```
TikTok internal log in level ERROR or Warning will callback in this method. You need to register log delegate in TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate
Usage:
```
TikTokOpenSDKApplicationDelegate.sharedInstance().logDelegate =self
```
Check TikTok is installed:
```
funcisAppInstalled() -> Bool
```

                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/green-screen-kit?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# Overview
TikTok OpenSDK now provides a seamless experience for your users to share content from your app as a green screen background using TikTok's famous green-screen effect. The green-screen effect lets users record a video with an image or video in the background and the creator's face in the forefront. Previously, creators would need to go through many steps to apply a green screen background with content from your app, but with the new release of our OpenSDK, your app can accomplish this by configuring a single field on our share request.
# iOS
### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you complete all of the steps in the [iOS Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-ios-quickstart).
### Green Screen Usage
To enable this feature, we provided a new field, `shareFormat`, in the share request object. To share content as a green screen background, set `shareFormat` equal to `.greenScreen`. If `shareFormat` is not set, it will be `.normal` by default. 
  1. Import the `TikTokOpenShareSDK` module and create a share request, as shown in the code snippet below. In the share request object, set the following parameters:
  * `localIdentifiers`: List of media. Media can either be all videos or all images.
  * `mediaType`: The type of media you want to share.
  * `redirectURI`: Universal link that's used to callback to your application
  1. On the share request, set the `shareFormat` equal to `.greenScreen`.
  2. Start the share request by calling the `send(_:)` method on the share request object.
  3. After the user finishes sharing, you will receive a response callback in the closure. In the share response object, you can find whether the share succeeded or failed.
```
/* Step 1 */import TikTokOpenShareSDK
let shareRequest =TikTokShareRequest(localIdentifiers: [...], // Must be single video                                           mediaType: .video, 
                                           redirectURI: "https://www.example.com/path")
/* Step 2 */shareRequest.shareFormat = .greenScreen 
/* Step 3 */shareRequest.send { response in/* Step 4 */let shareResponse = response as?TikTokShareResponseelse { return }
if shareResponse.errorCode == .noError {
print("Share succeeded!")
    } else {
print("Share Failed! 
               Error Code: \(shareResponse.errorCode.rawValue)               Error Message: \(shareResponse.errorMessage ??"")               Share State: \(shareResponse.shareState)")
    }
}
```
Note that: 
  1. This only applies to single video or image sharing. If multiple videos or images are shared, this field is ignored. 
  2. For videos, an extra step is presented to users to trim the shared video if needed before the recording. This is the same experience we have when the Green Screen effect is used with a video background.
  3. If TikTok fails to apply the Green Screen effect, we'll present a dialog for users to continue with regular sharing.
# Android 
### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you complete all of the steps in the [Android Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-android-quickstart).
### Green Screen Usage
To enable this feature, we provided a new field, `shareFormat`, in the share request. By default, it will be the regular video or image sharing we had previously. If the Green Screen enum value (`GR``EEN_SCREEN` on Android) is provided for single video or image sharing, TikTok will try to apply the Green Screen effect automatically and use the shared video or image as the Green Screen background. Your users can start recording the video seamlessly. 
  1. Create a `ShareApi` to send a share request.
  2. Build share content for images and videos into the `MediaContent` model.
  3. Create a `ShareRequest` object and set the required parameters with `shareFormat` equal to `Format.GREEN_SCREEN`.
  4. Call the `Share()` method in `ShareApi`.
```
/* Step 1 */shareApi = ShareApi(
    activity = [your_activity],
)
/* Step 2 */val mediaContent = MediaContent(
    mediaType = if (isSharingImage) MediaType.IMAGE else MediaType.VIDEO, 
    mediaPaths = mediaUrls, // a list of selected media paths)
/* Step 3 */val request = ShareRequest(
    clientKey = clientKey,
    mediaContent = mediaContent,
    shareFormat = Format.GREEN_SCREEN,
    packageName = [package name of your activity which will recive share result intent from TikTok, e.g com.bytedance.sdk.demo.share],
    resultActivityFullPath = [full classpathofyouractivitywhichwillreciveshareresultintentfromTikTok, e.g com.bytedance.sdk.demo.share.ShareActivity])
/* Step 4 */shareApi.share(request);
```
See the **Receive callbacks** section in [Share Kit for Android](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/share-kit-android-quickstart-v2) to handle share responses

# Manage Legacy User Access Tokens
Legacy user access tokens using our OAuth v1 API are deprecated. [View migration announcement](https://developers.tiktok.com/bulletin/migration-guidance-oauth-v1).
## Understanding the Basics
### OAuth
TikTok Login Kit manages the token lifecycle, allowing you to integrate login and authentication flows directly in your application. A successful authorization flow grants developers refreshable access tokens. Those tokens enable developers to perform endpoint access with user permissions.
### Authorization Scopes
Most endpoints provided by TikTok for Developers require direct consent from TikTok users before you can invoke them. The permissions are granted on a scope level. Users have the rights to only agree to a subset of scopes you requested from them.
Here are some example scopes:
  * **user.info****.basic** gives read-only access to a user's avatar and display name.
  * **video.list** gives read-only access to a user's public TikTok videos.
You can learn more about Scopes on our [Scopes Overview page](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview).
### Token Security
Tokens must be handled with extreme caution. We recommend storing and managing all tokens on the server side.
  * Access token is a user authorization token that can be used to directly access user information in the Tiktok ecosystem.
  * Refresh token is used to renew the access token. 
## Endpoints
### 1. Fetch Access Token Using Authorization Code
Once the authorization code callback is handled, you can use the code to retrieve the user's access token.
#### Endpoint
_POST_ `https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/access_token/`
#### Request Query Parameters
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
client_key | string | The unique identification key provisioned to the partner.  
client_secret | string | The unique identification secret provisioned to the partner.  
code | string | Authorization code from Web/iOS/Android authorization callback.  
grant_type | string | Its value should always be set as _authorization_code_.  
#### Response.Data Struct
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
open_id | string | The TikTok user's unique identifier.  
scope | string | The scopes user has agreed to authorize, separated by comma (,).  
access_token | string | The access token for future calls on behalf of the user.  
expires_in | int64 | Expiration for the `access_token` in seconds. **It is valid for 24 hours after initial issuance**.  
refresh_token | string | The token for refresh the `access_token`. **It is valid for 365 days after initial issuance**.  
refresh_expires_in | int64 | Expiration for the `refresh_token` in seconds.  
Make sure to store these values in your backend as they will be needed to persist access.
#### Code Example
```
app.get('/redirect', (req, res) => {
const { code, state } = req.query;
const { csrfState } = req.cookies;
if (state !== csrfState) {
        res.status(422).send('Invalid state');
return;
    }
let url_access_token = 'https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/access_token/';
    url_access_token += '?client_key=' + CLIENT_KEY;
    url_access_token += '&client_secret=' + CLIENT_SECRET;
    url_access_token += '&code=' + code;
    url_access_token += '&grant_type=authorization_code';
    fetch(url_access_token, {method: 'post'})
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(json => {
            res.send(json);
        });
})
```
If the request is not successful, the response will return the following error response body:
```
{
"data": {
"captcha": "",
"desc_url": "",
"description": "Parameter error",
"error_code": 10002    },
"message": "error"}
```
### 2. Refresh Access Token Using Refresh Token
Although the fetched `access_token` expires within 24 hours, it can be refreshed without user consent. The developer's backend server can schedule background jobs to keep tokens up to date.
#### Endpoint
_POST_ `https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/refresh_token/`
#### Request Query Parameters
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
client_key | string | The unique identification key provisioned to the partner.  
grant_type | string | Its value should always be set as _refresh_token_.  
refresh_token | string | The user's `refresh_token` received from `/oauth/access_token/` endpoint.  
#### Response.Data Struct
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
open_id | string | The partner-facing user id.  
scope | string | The scopes user has agreed to authorize, separated by comma (,).  
access_token | string | New token for future calls on behalf of the user.  
expires_in | int64 | Expiration for the access token in seconds.  
refresh_token | string |  The token for refresh an user's `access_token`.  Note that the returned refresh_token may be different than the one passed in the payload. **Developers must use the newly-returned token should the value is different than the previous one.**  
refresh_expires_in | int64 | Expiration for the `refresh_token` in seconds.  
Make sure to store these values in your backend as they will be needed to persist access.
```
app.get('/refresh_token/', (req, res) => {
const refresh_token = req.query.refresh_token;
let url_refresh_token = 'https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/refresh_token/';
    url_refresh_token += '?client_key=' + CLIENT_KEY;
    url_refresh_token += '&grant_type=refresh_token';
    url_refresh_token += '&refresh_token=' + refresh_token;
    fetch(url_refresh_token, {method: 'post'})
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(json => {
            res.send(json);
        });
})
```
### 3. Revoke Access
When users want to disconnect the connection between your application and TikTok, you can revoke their `access_tokens` so the users will no longer see your application show up on the **Manage app permissions** page within TikTok.
#### Endpoint
_POST_ `https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/revoke/`
#### Request Parameters
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
open_id | string | The TikTok user's unique identifier; obtained through `/oauth/access_token/` the user's unique token.  
access_token | string | The token that bears the authorization of the TikTok user, `/oauth/access_token/`. This token requires user authorization.  
#### Response.Data Struct
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
error_code | int64 | Error code.  
description | string | Error code description.  
```
app.get('/revoke', (req, res) => {
const { open_id, access_token } = req.query;
let url_revoke = 'https://open-api.tiktok.com/oauth/revoke/';
    url_revoke += '?open_id=' + open_id;
    url_revoke += '&access_token=' + access_token;
    fetch(url_revoke, {method: 'post'})
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(json => {
            res.send(json);
        });
})

There is a new version of this SDK: [Login Kit for Android](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-android-quickstart-v2)
# Login Kit for Android
## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate with Login Kit for Android using Swift. Once authenticated users authorize your app, you can access their basic TikTok profile data including their display name and avatar. Additional data access may require approval for additional Scopes. Learn more on [Scopes Overview](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview).
## Prerequisites
Obtain a client key and client secret by logging in to [Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps/) and selecting your app. Refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-android-quickstart) for detailed steps. You must also provide a signing key for your Android app, as described below.
### Android App Signing Key
While registering your app for the Android platform on Developer Portal, you'll be asked to submit a signing key for your Android app. That signing key is the MD5 hex digest of your installed release app which will be used as the signature. It looks similar to something like: `114326e82c81e639a52e5c023100f12a`.
There are 2 methods for obtaining the signature of the Android installation package:
  1. Obtained in the code, but you must know the package name of the installation package.
```
PackageManager manager = getPackageManager();
/** Get the package information of the specified package name including the signature through the package manager **/PackageInfo packageInfo = null;
try {
    packageInfo = manager.getPackageInfo("your package name", PackageManager.GET_SIGNATURES);
} catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
/** Get the signature array through the returned package information **/Signature[] signatures = packageInfo.signatures;
String ss = MD5.hexdigest(signatures[0].toByteArray());
if(ss != null) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "signature" + ss, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
} else {
    Toast.makeText(this, "No signature", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
/** Create an MD5 tool class **/publicclassMD5{
privatestaticfinalchar[] hexDigits = { 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102 };
publicstatic String hexdigest(String paramString){
try {
            String str = hexdigest(paramString.getBytes());
return str;
        } catch (Exception localException) {
        }
returnnull;
    }
publicstatic String hexdigest(byte[] paramArrayOfByte){
try {
            MessageDigest localMessageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
            localMessageDigest.update(paramArrayOfByte);
byte[] arrayOfByte = localMessageDigest.digest();
char[] arrayOfChar = newchar[32];
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
while (true) {
if (i >= 16)
returnnew String(arrayOfChar);
int k = arrayOfByte[i];
int m = j + 1;
                arrayOfChar[j] = hexDigits[(0xF & k >>> 4)];
                j = m + 1;
                arrayOfChar[m] = hexDigits[(k & 0xF)];
                i++;
            }
        } catch (Exception localException) {
        }
returnnull;
    }
}
```
  1. Inside of a terminal, enter the directory where *.jks is located, then enter into the command line:
```
keytool -list -v -keystore [xxx] -keypass [xxx]
```
Get the output MD5 value, then remove the ":" to obtain the required 32-character signature.
## Android Integration
### Request User Authorization
  1. Create an instance of `TiktokOpenApi`.
  2. Create an `Authorization.Request` instance and set the following required parameters:
    1. `request.scope = ``user.info``.basic`. If you are approved additional scopes , include them using comma-separated list.
    2. `request.state = "xxx"` . This is used to maintain the status of your request and callback. Verify that the `state` parameter returned in the callback matches what you sent earlier.
  3. Call the method `authorize()` on your instance of `TiktokOpenApi` .
```
// STEP 1: Create an instance of TiktokOpenApiTiktokOpenApi tiktokOpenApi= TikTokOpenApiFactory.create(this);
// STEP 2: Create an instance of Authorization.Request and set parametersAuthorization.Request request = new Authorization.Request();
    request.scope = "user.info.basic";
    request.state = "xxx";
return tiktokOpenApi.authorize(request);
// 3. Invoke the authorize methodtiktokOpenApi.authorize(request);
```
After successful authorization, the user will be brought back to your app via the `TikTokEntryActivity`.
### Receive Callbacks
We provide two ways for you to receive the callback data from TikTok:
  1. Create new activity named `TikTokEntryActivity` in your Android app and implement the `TikTokApiEventHandler` interface.
     * **Note** : The path of the activity should be in the format: `{your-p``ackage``-``name``}``.tiktokapi.TikTokEntryActivity`. For example, `com.``mycoolapp``.tiktokapi.TikTokEntryActivity`.
The following example demonstrates how to use the `TikTokEntryActivity` to receive the callback data:
```
classTikTokEntryActivityextendsActivityimplementsIApiEventHandler{
   TiktokOpenApi ttOpenApi;
@OverridepublicvoidonCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState){
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       ttOpenApi= TikTokOpenApiFactory.create(this);
       ttOpenApi.handleIntent(getIntent(),this); // receive and parse callback   }
@OverridepublicvoidonReq(BaseReq req){
   }
@OverridepublicvoidonResp(BaseResp resp){
if (resp instanceof Authorization.Response)  {
          Authorization.Response response = (Authorization.Response) resp;
          Toast.makeText(this, " code：" + response.errorCode + " errorMessage：" + response.errorMsg, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
      }
   }
@OverridepublicvoidonErrorIntent(@Nullable Intent intent){
       Toast.makeText(this, "Intent Error", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
   }
}
```
  1. Alternatively, you can customize your own activity to receive the callback. To do this, implement the interface `IApiEventHandler` and set your activity path by using parameter `callerLocalEntry`.
```
// request.callerLocalEntry = "com.xxx.xxx...activity";
```
To receive callbacks when people stay in TikTok, please register to receive a broadcast:
```
publicstaticfinal String ACTION_STAY_IN_TT = "com.aweme.opensdk.action.stay.in.dy";
```
### Obtain Access Token
Upload the `code` returned in the callback to your server-side and obtain a user access token. See [Manage User Access Tokens](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/legacy-user-access-guide) for more information.
### Handling Errors
See [Error Codes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-android-handling-errors) for error handling and debugging.

# Login Kit for Android
This guide explains how to integrate with Login Kit for Android using Kotlin. Once authenticated users authorize your app, you can access their basic TikTok profile data, including their display name and avatar. Additional data access may require approval for additional scopes. Learn more about [scopes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview). 
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you complete all of the steps in the [Android Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-android-quickstart).
Obtain the `client_key` and `client_secret` located in the **Credentials** section of your app page on the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/). Navigate to the **Products** section of your app page and click **Add products**. Then add **Login Kit**.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/af5c662febd461e19a91be80c5f5c50b)
## Android integration
### Create an authorization request
  1. Create an instance of `AuthApi`.
  2. Create an `AuthRequest` instance and set the following required parameters:
    1. `clientKey = your_client_key`: Use the client key that you obtain on the TikTok for Developers website.
    2. `scope = ``user.info``.basic`: If you are approved for additional scopes, include them using a comma-separated list.
    3. `redirectUri = your_redirectUri`: Redirect URI determines how TikTok sends back the response to your app. The value must match one of the authorized redirect URIs that you provide for your Android Login Kit and follow an `https` scheme.
    4. `codeVerifier = your_codeverifier`: Generate a code verifier with `PKCEUtils`.
  3. Call the `authorize()` method on your instance of `AuthApi` .
```
// STEP 1: Create an instance of AuthApival authApi = AuthApi(
    activity = [your_activity]
)
// STEP 2: Create an AuthRequest and set parametersval request = AuthRequest(
    clientKey = clientKey,
    scope = "user.info.basic",
    redirectUri = redirectUri, 
    codeVerifier = codeVerifier
)
// STEP 3: Invoke the authorize methodauthApi.authorize(
    request = request,
    authMethod = AuthMethod.TikTokApp / AuthMethod.ChromeTab
);
```
After successful authorization, the user will be brought back to your app via the activity associated with `redirectUri`.
### Receive callbacks
```
// the actvity which will receive the authorization response from TikTok<activity>
    ...
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
// Note that VIEW action, and DEFAULT & BROWSAbLE categories are necessary.        <data android:scheme="your_redirect_uri_scheme" />
        <data android:host="your_redirect_uri_host"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```
Parse the AuthResponse from intent with `authApi.getAuthResponseFromIntent`. Refer to `MainActivity` in the `demo-auth` package as an example.
```
authApi.getAuthResponseFromIntent(intent, [your_redirect_uri])?.let { 
val authCode = it.authCode // The auth code will be used to obtain access tokenval grantedPermissions = it.grantedPermissions // Granted scopes// Please refer to the Handling Errors for more detail.val authError = it.authError
val authErrorDescription = it.authErrorDescription
    ...
}
```
### Obtain an access token
Upload the `code` returned in the callback and your `code_verifier` to your server-side and obtain a user access token. See [User Access Token Management](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/oauth-user-access-token-management) for more information. 
### Handling errors

# Login Kit for Desktop
This guide details how to enable authentication from your desktop app to TikTok. After successfully completing authentication with TikTok, developers can obtain an `access_token` for the TikTok user.
## Prerequisites
### Register your app
Register your app following [these steps](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app/). Then obtain a **Client key** and **Client secret** from the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/) by clicking your profile icon in the navigation bar, clicking **Manage apps** , and then selecting the relevant app. 
### Configure Redirect URI
Redirect URI is required for desktop apps. After the user completes authorization with Login Kit on the desktop, they will be redirected to the URI that you provide. This redirect URI must be registered in the Login Kit product configuration for your app.
The following are restrictions for registering redirect URIs.
  * A maximum of 10 URIs is supported.
  * The length of each URI must be fewer than 512 characters.
  * URIs must be absolute and begin with `https` or `http`.
  * URIs must be static. Parameters or fragment CANNOT be appended to the URI.
  * Only `localhost` or loopback IP `127.0.0.1` are allowed host names in URI.
  * URIs must have a port number, and wildcard port number (*) is supported. Wildcard config is recommended if your redirect URI uses a random port number.
  * The following are some examples of valid redirect URIs:
    * `http://localhost:3455/callback/`
    * `http://127.0.0.1:*/callback/`
    * `https://127.0.0.1:3455/callback/`
## Integration Guide
### Implement the front-end code
Get started by connecting your front-end login button to the server endpoint. The following is an example in HTML:
```
<ahref='{SERVER_ENDPOINT_OAUTH}'>Continue with TikTok</a>
```
### Implement the server code to handle authorization grant flow
The server code must be responsible for the following:
  * Ensuring that the client secret and refresh token are stored securely.
  * Ensuring that the security for each user is protected by preventing request forgery attacks.
  * Handling the refresh flow before access token expiry.
  * Managing the access token request flow for each user.
#### Redirect request to TikTok's authorization server
##### Create an anti-forgery state token
You must prevent request forgery attacks to protect the security of your users. The first step before making the redirect request to TikTok's authorization server is to create a unique session token to maintain the state between the request and callback.
You will later match this unique session token with the authentication response to verify that the user is making the request and is not a malicious attacker.
One of the simple approaches to a state token is a randomly generated alphanumeric string constructed using a random-number generator, like the following example.
```
let array = newUint8Array(30); 
const csrfState = window.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
```
##### Generate a code verifier and code challenge
TikTok requires the 
  * You should generate a new code verifier every time you initialize an authorization request. 
  * You must use hex encoding of SHA256 to generate the code challenge from the code verifier. 
Here's how to generate a code verifier and code challenge:
  * **code_verifier**
Generate a high-entropy cryptographic random string using the unreserved characters [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" , with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters.
```
functiongenerateRandomString(length) {
var result = '';
var characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-._~';
var charactersLength = characters.length;
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    result += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * charactersLength));
  }
return result;
}
```
  * **code_challenge**
Create the code challenge by hashing the code verifier using hex encoding of SHA256. Since we only support S256 as `code_challenge_method`, use `code_challenge = SHA256(code_verifier)`.
```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.9-1/crypto-js.min.js"></script>
// CryptoJS requiredcode_challenge = CryptoJS.SHA256(code_verifier).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
```
##### Initial redirect to TikTok's authorization page
To make the initial redirect request to TikTok's authorization server, the following query parameters below must be added to the Authorization Page URL using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.
For example, you can use an **UTF-8** as the destination character set.
**Parameter** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
`client_key` | string | The unique identification key provisioned to the partner  
`scope` | string | A comma (,) separated string of authorization scope(s). These scope(s) are assigned to your application on the TikTok for Developers website. They handle what content your application can and cannot access. If a scope is toggleable, the user can deny access to one scope while granting access to others.  
`redirect_uri` | string | The redirect URI that you requested for your application. It must match one of the redirect URIs you registered for the app.  
`state` |  string   
|  The state is used to maintain the state of your request and callback. This value will be included when redirecting the user back to the client. Check if the state returned in the callback matches what you sent earlier to prevent cross-site request forgery. The state can also include customized parameters that you want TikTok service to return.  
`response_type` | string | This value should always be set to `code`  
`code_challenge` | string | SHA256 hash of `code_verifier` that will be used as a server-side challenge during authorization code exchange  
`code_challenge_method` | string | This value should always be set to `S256`  
Redirect your users to the authorization page URL and supply the necessary query parameters. Note that the page can only be accessed through HTTPS.
**Type** | **Description**  
---|---  
URL | `https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/`  
Query parameters   
| `client_key=<client_key>&response_type=code&scope=<scope>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&state=<state>&code_challenge=<code_challenge>&code_challenge_method=S256`  
The following is an example using Node, Express, and JavaScript:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(cors());
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000).
const CLIENT_KEY = 'your_client_key'// this value can be found in app's developer portalconst SERVER_ENDPOINT_REDIRECT = 'your_redirect_uri'// redirect URI should be registered in developer portalconst CODE_VERIFIER = 'your_unique_code_verifier'const CODE_CHALLENGE = 'SHA256_hash_of_code_verifier'app.get('/oauth', (req, res) => {
const csrfState = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
    res.cookie('csrfState', csrfState, { maxAge: 60000 });
let url = 'https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/';
// the following params need to be in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.    url += '?client_key={CLIENT_KEY}';
    url += '&scope=user.info.basic';
    url += '&response_type=code';
    url += '&redirect_uri={SERVER_ENDPOINT_REDIRECT}';
    url += '&state=' + csrfState;
    url += '&code_challenge={CODE_VERIFIER}';
    url += '&code_challenge_method=S256'    res.redirect(url);
})
```
#### TikTok prompts a users to log in or sign up
The authorization page takes the user to the TikTok website if the user is not logged in. They are then prompted to log in or sign up for TikTok.
#### TikTok prompts a user for consent
After logging in or signing up, an authorization page asks the user for consent to allow your application to access your requested permissions.
#### Manage authorization response
If the user authorizes access, they will be redirected to `redirect_uri` with the following query parameters appended using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format:
**Parameter** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
`code`   
| string | Authorization code that is used in getting an access token  
`scopes`   
| string | A comma-separated (,) string of authorization scope(s), which the user has granted  
`state`   
| string | A unique, non-guessable string when making the initial authorization request. This value allows you to prevent CSRF attacks by confirming that the value coming from the response matches the one you sent.  
`error`   
| string | If this field is set, the current user is not eligible for using third-party login or authorization. The partner is responsible for handling the error gracefully.  
`error_description`   
| string | If this field is set, it will be a human-readable description about the error  
#### Manage access token
Using the `code` appended to your `redirect_uri`, you can obtain `access_token` for the user, which completes the flow for logging in with TikTok.

# Login Kit with Objective-C
There is a new version of this SDK: [Login Kit for iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-ios-quickstart)
### Overview
This guide explains how to integrate with Login Kit for iOS using Objective-C. Once authenticated users authorize your app, you can access their basic TikTok profile data including their display name and avatar. Additional data access may require approval for additional Scopes. Learn more on [Scopes Overview](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview).
### Prerequisites
Obtain a client key and client secret by logging in to [Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps/) and selecting your app. Refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-ios-quickstart-objective-c) for detailed steps.
### iOS Integration
#### Authorization Request
  1. Create a `TikTokOpenSDKAuthRequest` and set `permissions` equal to the set of scopes you are requesting from the user. For example, `user.info``.basic,video.list`.
  2. Send the authorization request.
  3. If user authorization was successful, a `code` will be provided in the response. 
  4. Upload this `code` to your server-side and obtain a user access token. See [Manage User Access Tokens](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/legacy-user-access-guide) for more information.
These steps are demonstrated in the following code snippet: 
```
#import <TikTokOpenSDK/TikTokOpenSDKAuth.h>/* STEP 1: Create the request and set permissions */NSArray *scopes = @"user.info.basic,video.list"; // list your scopes;NSOrderedSet *scopesSet = [NSOrderedSet orderedSetWithArray:scopes];
TikTokOpenSDKAuthRequest *request = [[TikTokOpenSDKAuthRequest alloc] init];
request.permissions = scopesSet;
/* STEP 2: Send the request */__weaktypeof(self) ws = self;
[request sendAuthRequestViewController:self                completion:^(TikTokOpenSDKAuthResponse *_Nonnull resp) {
    __strongtypeof(ws) sf = ws;
/* STEP 3: Parse and handle the response */if (resp.errCode == 0) {
NSString *responseCode = resp.code;
// Upload response code to your server and obtain user access token        ... 
    } else {
// User authorization failed. Handle errors    }
}];
```
#### Handling Errors
See [Error Codes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-ios-handling-errors) for error handling and debugging.

# Login Kit for iOS
This guide explains how to integrate your app with Login Kit for iOS. After successful user authentication with TikTok, your app can access basic user data, such as display name and avatar. Access to additional user data requires approval from TikTok for Developers website.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you complete all of the steps in the [iOS Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-ios-quickstart).
Obtain the `client_key` and `client_secret` located in the **Credentials** section of your app page on the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/). Navigate to the **Products** section of your app page and click **Add products**. Then add **Login Kit**.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/af5c662febd461e19a91be80c5f5c50b)
You must also register a redirect URI on the TikTok for Developers website. This redirect URI is used to verify your application, as well as to callback to your application with an authorization response. This redirect URI must be a `https` scheme and your app must support 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/27ce7b196b1eb3e587e0dc44f81674f9)
## iOS integration
### Create an authorization request and handle responses
For the following steps, your app is required to maintain a strong reference to the request to receive the response callback. You can discard it once you have handled the response.
  1. Import the `TikTokOpenAuthSDK` module and create an authorization request, as shown in the code snippet below. In the authorization request init method, set the following parameters.
     * `scopes`: The set of scopes you are requesting from the user.
     * `redirectURI`: Universal link that's used to callback to your application
  2. Start the login by calling the `send(_:)` method on the authorization request object.
  3. After the user finishes authorizing, you will receive a response callback in the closure. In the authorization response object, you can find whether the authorization request succeeded or failed.
```
/* Step 1 */import TikTokOpenAuthSDK
let authRequest =TikTokAuthRequest(scopes: ["user.info.basic",...], 
                                    redirectURI: "https://www.example.com/path")
/* Step 2 */authRequest.send { response in/* Step 3 */let authResponse = response as?TikTokAuthResponseelse { return }
if authResponse.errorCode == .noError {
print("Auth code: \(authResponse.code)")
    } else {
print("Authorization Failed! 
              Error: \(authResponse.error ??"")              Error Description: \(authResponse.errorDescription ??"")")
    }
}
```
Alternatively, you can pass in a `nil` completion handler to the authorization request and create a `TikTokAuthResponse` directly from the URL sent back by TikTok in the `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` AppDelegate function. In this case, you do not have to maintain a strong reference to the authorization request.
### Obtain an access token
Upload the `TikTokAuthResponse.code` returned in the callback and the `TikTokAuthRequest.pkce.codeVerifier` to your server-side and obtain a user access token. See [User Access Token Management](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/oauth-user-access-token-management) for more information.

# Manage User Access Tokens with OAuth v2
TikTok Login Kit manages the token life cycle, allowing you to integrate login and authentication flows directly in your application. A successful authorization flow grants you refreshable access tokens. Those tokens enable you to perform endpoint access with user permissions.
### Authorization scopes
Most endpoints provided by TikTok for Developers require direct consent from TikTok users before you can invoke them. The permissions are granted on a scope level. Users have the rights to only agree to a subset of scopes you requested from them.
The following are some example scopes:
Learn more about [scopes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview).
### Token security
Tokens must be handled with caution. It is recommended that you store and manage all tokens on the server side.
  * Access token is a user authorization token that can be used to directly access user information in the TikTok ecosystem.
  * Refresh token is used to renew the access token. 
## Endpoints For Web
If you have already registered a redirect URI for your web app and use `https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/` to authorize, please refer to the [new generation user access token management API guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/oauth-user-access-token-management).
If you are an existing client, have not registered a redirect URI for your web app and use `https://www.tiktok.com/auth/authorize/` to authorize, please refer to the [legacy user access token management API guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/legacy-user-access-guide). To register a redirect URI, go to the [Manage apps](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps/) page of the TikTok for Developers website and migrate to the new endpoints as soon as possible.
## Endpoints for Mobile
**Preferred:** If you are using the new [Android](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-android-quickstart) or [iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-ios-quickstart) TikTok OpenSDK, please refer to the new [user access token management guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/oauth-user-access-token-management).

# Login Kit
Integrating with our Login Kit enables users to quickly and securely sign into your app with their TikTok account. LoginKit is available on [iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-ios-quickstart), [Android](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-android-quickstart-v2), [Desktop](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-desktop/) and [Web](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-web). Login Kit is based on 
After successfully completing authentication with TikTok, your application will be able to request access to basic user data such as display name and avatar. For requesting access to additional data from users, pre-approval will be required in your TikTok app on developers.tiktok.com.
Once users have approved your access, you can view basic user data with our Display APIs. Learn more [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/display-api-get-started).

# Login Kit with QR Code
If you are using our deprecated v1 endpoint for QR code authorizations, please migrate to our v2 endpoint immediately. [Learn more](https://developers.tiktok.com/bulletin/migration-guidance-qr-code-authorization-v2).
## Overview
This guide will explain how to integrate with the Login Kit to facilitate user authorization via QR code login. Once an authenticated user authorizes your app, you can access their basic TikTok profile data such as their display name and avatar. Additional data access may require approval for additional scopes. Learn more about [scopes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview).
## Prerequisites
Obtain a client key and client secret by logging into the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/). Then go to the **Manage apps** page and select your app. 
### Security advisory: Verifying integrity using client_ticket
The `client_ticket` mentioned throughout this guide enables you to verify the data integrity of the response. While your app may still function even if you don't validate the `client_ticket`, doing so introduces security risks. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you always verify that the `client_ticket` matches the one generated by you, and reject any response where this validation fails as it may have been compromised by a malicious attacker.
#### Generating a client_ticket
Your `client_ticket` can be any series of characters, letters, or symbols, as long as it is URL safe and the URL-encoded version is under 512 characters. The generation method is at your discretion as there are no complexity requirements. You may reuse the same `client_ticket`, but some randomness is recommended for security. You should persist the ticket for the entirety of the QR code process as it will be needed when checking the validity of the QR status.
## Integration
Your web app must implement the following functionality on the server side:
  1. Generate a QR code.
    1. Request a QR code URL (see the below sections for API guidance).
    2. Generate a `client_ticket`.
    3. Insert the client ticket into the QR code URL.
    4. Render the URL.
    5. Display it to the user.
  2. Repeatedly check the QR code status and refresh or disable it accordingly (see the below sections for API guidance).
  3. Parse the response for the provided authorization code once the QR code status is changed to `confirmed`.
  4. Request an access token and refresh token from TikTok using the authorization code and client key.
  5. Notify the user of authorization success or failure.
  6. Use the access token to fetch authorized user data, and use the refresh token to extend the access token's expiration time.
For more information on access and refresh tokens, see [Manage User Access Tokens](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens).

A successful response will include the `scan_qrcode_url` and `token` fields. Once obtained, please perform the following steps:
  1. Extract the `scan_qrcode_url`.
  2. Generate a unique ticket using your preferred approach, such as an alphanumeric string such as `2ncv7awq`. Persist this ticket alongside your service.
  3. In the previously extracted `scan_qrcode_url`, replace the value of the `client_ticket` query parameter with your ticket. For example, `scan_qrcode_url=...&client_ticket=tobefilled&...` should be replaced by `scan_qrcode_url=...&client_ticket=your_ticket&...`.
  4. Use the modified `scan_qrcode_url` to generate a QR code.
  5. Display the QR code to your user.
### Example response

# Login Kit for Web
This guide details how to enable authentication from your web app to TikTok. After successfully completing authentication with TikTok, developers can obtain an `access_token` for the TikTok user.
### Register your app
Register your app following [these steps](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app). Then obtain a client key and secret from the developer portal on [https://developers.tiktok.com](https://developers.tiktok.com/) under **Manage apps**.
### Configure redirect URI
Redirect URI is required for web apps. After the user completes authorization with Login Kit on the web, they will be redirected to a URI provided by you. This redirect URI must be registered in the Login Kit product configuration for your app.
The following are restrictions for registering redirect URIs.
  * A maximum of 10 URIs is supported.
  * The length of each URI must be less than 512 characters.
  * URIs must be absolute and begin with `https`. For example:
    * Correct: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
    * Incorrect: `dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
  * URIs must be static. Parameters will be denied. For example:
    * Correct: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
    * Incorrect: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/?id=1`
  * URIs cannot include a fragment, or hash character (#):
    * Correct: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/`
    * Incorrect: `https://dev.example.com/auth/callback/#100`
##### Create an anti-forgery state token
You must prevent request forgery attacks to protect the security of your users. The first step before making the redirect request to TikTok's authorization server is to create a unique session token to maintain the state between the request and callback.
You will later match this unique session token with the authentication response to verify that the user is making the request and not a malicious attacker.
One of the simple approaches to a state token is a randomly generated alphanumeric string constructed using a random-number generator. For example:
##### Initial redirect to TikTok's authorization page
To make the initial redirect request to TikTok's authorization server, the following query parameters below must be added to the Authorization Page URL using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.
For example, you can use an **UTF-8** as the destination character set.
**Parameter** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
`client_key` | String | The unique identification key provisioned to the partner.  
`scope` |  String   
| A comma (,) separated string of authorization scope(s). These scope(s) are assigned to your application on the TikTok for Developers website. They handle what content your application can and cannot access. If a scope is toggleable, the user can deny access to one scope while granting access to others.  
`redirect_uri` | String | The redirect URI that you requested for your application. It must match one of the redirect URIs you registered for the app.  
`state` | String |  The state is used to maintain the state of your request and callback. This value will be included when redirecting the user back to the client. Check if the state returned in the callback matches what you sent earlier to prevent cross-site request forgery. The state can also include customized parameters that you want TikTok service to return.  
`response_type` | String | This value should always be set to `code`.  
`disable_auto_auth` | int | Controls whether the authorization page is automatically presented to users. When set to 0, skips the authorization page for valid sessions. When set to 1, always displays the authorization page.  
Redirect your users to the authorization page URL and supply the necessary query parameters. Note that the page can only be accessed through HTTPS.
**Type** | **Description**  
---|---  
URL | `https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/`  
Query parameters   
| `client_key=<client_key>&response_type=code&scope=<scope>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&state=<state>`  
Note: If you are an existing client and use `https://www.tiktok.com/auth/authorize/` as the authorization page URL, please [register a redirect URI](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps/) for your app and migrate to the new URL mentioned above.
The following is an example using Node, Express, and JavaScript:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(cors());
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000).
const CLIENT_KEY = 'your_client_key'// this value can be found in app's developer portalapp.get('/oauth', (req, res) => {
const csrfState = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
    res.cookie('csrfState', csrfState, { maxAge: 60000 });
let url = 'https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/';
// the following params need to be in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format.    url += '?client_key={CLIENT_KEY}';
    url += '&scope=user.info.basic';
    url += '&response_type=code';
    url += '&redirect_uri={SERVER_ENDPOINT_REDIRECT}';
    url += '&state=' + csrfState;
    res.redirect(url);
})
```
| String | Authorization code that is used in getting an access token.  
`scopes`   
| String | A comma-separated (,) string of authorization scope(s), which the user has granted.  
`state`   
|  String   
| A unique, non-guessable string when making the initial authorization request. This value allows you to prevent CSRF attacks by confirming that the value coming from the response matches the one you sent.  
`error`   
|  String   
| If this field is set, it means that the current user is not eligible for using third-party login or authorization. The partner is responsible for handling the error gracefully.  
`error_description`   
| String | If this field is set, it will be a human-readable description about the error.  
#### Manage access token
Using the `code` appended to your `redirect_uri`, you can obtain `access_token` for the user, which completes the flow for logging in with TikTok.

# TikTok OpenSDK for Android - Quickstart
TikTok OpenSDK for Android is a Gradle project that allows you to integrate with native TikTok app functions. With OpenSDK, you can enable your users to log into your app with TikTok, and then share images and videos to their TikTok profiles. Checkout 
## Getting started
The minimum system requirement is an API level of 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or later. 
### Step 1: Configure TikTok app settings for Android
Register your app on the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/). 
You must provide your MD5 and SHA256 certificate fingerprint during the app registration process. 
  * If your app uses 
  * If your app is using self-signing, you can follow the instructions below to use Keytool or Gradle's Signing Report to get your MD5 and SHA-256. 
    * Using Keytool
Open a terminal and run the `keytool` utility to get the MD5 and SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate.
```
keytool -list -v \
-alias <your-key-name> -keystore <path-to-production-keystore>
```
```
MD5: 75:C8:69:FC:D5:6E:EB:1D:02:79:A9:3F:91:BD:5E:5B
SHA1: EE:26:47:EC:59:83:6A:91:3C:7A:E1:61:14:56:6D:D8:90:B7:BA:3E
SHA-256: 6C:CF:15:C0:17:2E:EF:3E:48:2F:7E:E8:ED:6D:06:CB:CB:52:A4:CF:AD:CE:42:0B:80:9D:D5:D9:DE:DA:4C:7D
```
  * Using Gradle's Signing Report
```
./gradlew signingReport
```
The signing report includes the signing information for each of your app's variants. Copy the MD5 and SHA-256 of the release variant.
```
Store: <your_keystore_location>
Alias: <your_keystore_alias>
MD5: 75:C8:69:FC:D5:6E:EB:1D:02:79:A9:3F:91:BD:5E:5B
SHA1: EE:26:47:EC:59:83:6A:91:3C:7A:E1:61:14:56:6D:D8:90:B7:BA:3E
SHA-256: 6C:CF:15:C0:17:2E:EF:3E:48:2F:7E:E8:ED:6D:06:CB:CB:52:A4:CF:AD:CE:42:0B:80:9D:D5:D9:DE:DA:4C:7D
```
  * Provide the MD5 and SHA-256 for your app on the TikTok for Developers website.
    * In the **App signature** field, remove the colon ( : ) from your MD5 string and provide the 32-character signature.
    * In the **Signing certificate fingerprints** field, provide your SHA-256 string directly.

### Step 2: Install the SDK and set up the Android project
  1. In the **Project** window, switch to the **Android view** tab.
  2. Open **Gradle****Scripts** and locate `build.gradle` (Project). 
  3. Add the following repository in the `repositories{}` section:
  1. Open**Gradle****Scripts** and locate `build.gradle` (Module: app).
  2. Add the following implementation statement to the `dependencies{}` section.
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.tiktok.open.sdk:tiktok-open-sdk-core:latest.release'    implementation 'com.tiktok.open.sdk:tiktok-open-sdk-auth:latest.release'// to use authorization api    implementation 'com.tiktok.open.sdk:tiktok-open-sdk-share:latest.release'// to use share api}
```
You can find the latest release 
Note:
Due to package visibility changes in Android 11, the implementation of TikTok SDK for devices targeting Android 11 and later requires you to add the following to the Android manifest file.
```
<queries><packageandroid:name="com.zhiliaoapp.musically" /><packageandroid:name="com.ss.android.ugc.trill" /></queries>
```
Sync your project and get the latest version of the SDK package.
At this point, the basic development environment setup is complete.

  1. Add the following code to your app's `AppDelegate`:
```
import TikTokOpenSDKCore
@mainclassAppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate{
funcapplication(_app: UIApplication,openurl: URL, 
options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
if (TikTokURLHandler.handleOpenURL(url)) {
returntrue        }
returnfalse    }
funcapplication(_application: UIApplication, 
continueuserActivity: NSUserActivity, 
restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
if (TikTokURLHandler.handleOpenURL(userActivity.webpageURL)) {
returntrue        }
returnfalse    }
}
```
  1. If your application makes use of the `SceneDelegate`, you will need to add the following code to your `SceneDelegate` file.
```
import TikTokOpenSDKCore
classSceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate{
funcscene(_scene: UIScene, 
openURLContextsURLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {
if (TikTokURLHandler.handleOpenURL(URLContexts.first?.url)) {
return        }
    }
}
```

# Endpoints
## 1. Fetch an access token using an authorization code
Once the authorization code callback is handled, you can use the code to retrieve the user's access token.
#### Endpoint
_POST_ https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/
#### Headers
**Key** | **Value**  
---|---  
Content-Type | application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
#### Request body parameters
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
client_key | string | The unique identification key provisioned to the partner.  
client_secret | string | The unique identification secret provisioned to the partner.  
code   
|  string   
| The authorization code from the web, iOS, Android or desktop authorization callback. The value should be **URL****decoded**.  
grant_type | string | Its value should always be set as `authorization_code`.  
redirect_uri   
| string | Its value must be the same as the `redirect_uri` used for requesting code.   
code_verifier | string | **Required for mobile and desktop app only.** Code verifier is used to generate code challenge in PKCE authorization flow.  
#### Response struct
**Key** | **Type** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
open_id | string | The TikTok user's unique identifier.  
scope | string | A comma-separated list (,) of the scopes the user has agreed to authorize.  
access_token | string | The access token for future calls on behalf of the user.  
expires_in   
| int64 | The expiration of `access_token` in seconds. It is valid for 24 hours after initial issuance.  
refresh_token | string | The token to refresh `access_token`. It is valid for 365 days after the initial issuance.  
refresh_expires_in   
| int64 | The expiration of `refresh_token` in seconds.  
token_type | string | The value should be `Bearer`.  
Make sure to store these values on your back end as they are needed to persist access.
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
--data-urlencode 'client_key=CLIENT_KEY' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET' \
--data-urlencode 'code=CODE' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI'
```
If the request is successful, the response will look like the following.
```
{
"access_token": "act.example12345Example12345Example",
"expires_in": 86400,
"open_id": "afd97af1-b87b-48b9-ac98-410aghda5344",
"refresh_expires_in": 31536000,
"refresh_token": "rft.example12345Example12345Example",
"scope": "user.info.basic,video.list",
"token_type": "Bearer"}
```
If the request is not successful, an error response body will be returned in the response, like the following.
```
{
"error": "invalid_request",
"error_description": "Redirect_uri is not matched with the uri when requesting code.",
"log_id": "202206221854370101130062072500FFA2"}
```
## 2. Refresh an access token using a refresh token
Although the fetched `access_token` expires within 24 hours, it can be refreshed without user consent. The developer's back-end server can schedule background jobs to keep tokens up to date.
#### Request body parameters

---|---|---  
open_id | string | The partner-facing user ID.  
scope   
| string | A comma-separated list (,) of the scopes the user has agreed to authorize.  
access_token   
| string | The new token for future calls on behalf of the user.  
expires_in | int64 | The expiration of the access token in seconds.  
refresh_token   
| string |  The token to refresh a user's `access_token`.  Note: The returned `refresh_token` may be different than the one passed in the payload. You must use the newly-returned token if the value is different than the previous one.  
refresh_expires_in   
| int64 | The expiration for `refresh_token` in seconds.  
token_type | string | The value should be `Bearer`.  
Make sure to store these values on your back end as they are needed to persist access.
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/token/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
--data-urlencode 'client_key=CLIENT_KEY' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
--data-urlencode 'refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN'
```
```
{
"access_token": "act.example12345Example12345Example",
"expires_in": 86400,
"open_id": "asdf-12345c-1a2s3d-ac98-asdf123as12as34",
"refresh_expires_in": 31536000,
"refresh_token": "rft.example12345Example12345Example",
"scope": "user.info.basic,video.list",

```
## 3. Revoke access
When a user wants to disconnect your application from TikTok, you can revoke their tokens so the user will no longer see your application on the **Manage app permissions** page of the TikTok for Developers website.
#### Endpoint

client_key   
| string | The unique identification key provisioned to the partner.  
client_secret | string | The unique identification secret provisioned to the partner.  
token | string | The `access_token` that bears the authorization of the TikTok user.  
#### Response struct
If the request is successful, the response struct will be empty.
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/oauth/revoke/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
--data-urlencode 'client_key=CLIENT_KEY' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET' \
--data-urlencode 'token=ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

# Developer Guidelines
We are excited that you are seeking to integrate your app with TikTok. As developers, you can help us inspire creativity and bring joy by providing awesome experiences for TikTok users. This page provides guidelines for you to better understand our integration processes and requirements.
## App review process
To provide a safe and reliable experience for TikTok users, all apps seeking to integrate with our APIs and SDKs in Live are reviewed.
If an app is in Live, it means it can integrate with our APIs and SDKs for authorized access to data of TikTok end users.
After your apps are approved, requests for modification may require further reviews depending on the attributes being changed. Our review process may also provide feedback to improve your integration with TikTok.
### Submission requirements
  1. Make sure your app is functioning during our review process. You are required to provide demo accounts and capabilities to our approvers free of charge, if requested.
    1. For incomplete apps, beta or development versions, and test versions, you are encouraged to use [Sandbox mode](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/add-a-sandbox) to test out our integrations.
  2. Follow our guidelines throughout the duration of your integration with TikTok. Any violations of our guidelines found through auditing, user complaints, or other means will likely lead to immediate revocation of your integration and a permanent ban on all future integrations by your account and business entity.
  3. Verify ownership of all configurations with a URL, including your Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and more. Learn more about [URL verification](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app#verify_url_ownership).
Note: We do not provide an official review timeline or any guarantees for approval. While we do our best to accommodate all requests and communicate promptly, this is a manual process and response times may vary. We remind you to factor the review process into your launch timelines and planning. 
## Developer Principles
### Provide great experiences
By integrating with TikTok, you are helping us expand the ecosystem of experiences available to our users. Therefore, we expect your app to provide significant additional value to TikTok and its end users. Don't just build great experiences, maintain them! Even if your app is approved for integration, failure to maintain a quality experience can lead to revocation of your integration.
### Build awesome interfaces
Great experiences start with easy to understand and intuitive interfaces. Bad experiences cause user frustration so we want to avoid them. All app UI must follow industry best practices for user experience and interface design. Additionally, to maintain diversity and inclusion standards across apps, be mindful of localized expectations such as language and prioritize accessibility capabilities.
If your users are developers themselves, make sure your APIs and SDKs behave as expected based on their interface and model. Avoid overly complicated or confusing API contracts.
### Be reliable
Apps with complaints of frequent outages, timeouts, or poor performance can be rejected or have their integration revoked. To avoid this, regularly track your latency, success rates, and service availability. Manage service incidents promptly and fix any bugs in your app. Treat issues related to data security and critical functionality (for example, payments) with urgency.
### Be trustworthy
Great experiences are transparent with users and give them control of their data and content. Be very clear with users about the purpose of your app and your integration with TikTok. Provide mechanisms for users to contact you directly, and promptly address their concerns. Don't engage in any deceptive or misleading communication. Never misguide users into thinking that you are part of the TikTok app, or, for that matter, any other app or entity that doesn't belong to you. As a reminder, make sure you have read and comply with our 
Understand that the user's data belongs to them. You must safeguard their data. Don't share it with anyone without their proper consent. 
Here are some example behaviors to maintain trust:
  1. Never remove a creator's copyright mechanisms (such as watermarks) without consent.
  2. Protect the user's identity and anonymity.
    1. If you have access to a user's PII (Personally Identifiable Information), never share it with anyone without their consent.
  3. Follow all data sharing and privacy laws to build trust with users and governments.
  4. Set an accurate description, title, and icon for your app.
  5. Disclose your app's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
  6. Verify URL ownership. 
  7. Provide all required data when configuring your app integration and developer profile.
**Note:** Providing fake or incomplete data may lead to the rejection of your app and delays in your integration.
## TikTok Integration Maintenance Requirements
  1. You must actively maintain communication with TikTok when requested. Failure to respond to correspondence in a timely manner can lead to termination of your integration.
    1. Check your email filters and make sure our communications are not landing in your spam or junk mail folders.
    2. Any sensitive communication relating to topics including but not limited to security, privacy, compliance, and user deception must be addressed immediately regarding these matters.
  2. TikTok reserves the right to deprecate APIs and SDKs. You must prioritize and update your integration as new features are offered by TikTok for Developers.
  3. You will be given notice when backward incompatible changes are made to our APIs. You must prevent any user interfaces from being broken because of deprecated integrations by promptly migrating to newer APIs.
  4. For any security, privacy, and compliance related concerns, you must immediately acknowledge communication from TikTok and update your integration.
  5. Respect our API throttling limits. It goes without saying, don't use your integration to attack us, our users, or anyone else with denial of service attempts, spam, etc. That's a surefire way to get banned forever and find yourself in more trouble than you or we need.

# Frequently Asked Questions
  1. **What data is available as part of the Research****Tools****?**
More information about public data accessible via our Research Tools can be found [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/).
For detailed information on the data returned via our tools, check out the[ codebook](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/research-api-codebook/).
  1. **How do I know if I qualify for access to TikTok's Research Tools ?**
Applicants must fulfill our criteria described [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/) to be eligible for access to Research Tools.
  1. **How do I apply for Research****Tools****access?**
If you meet the eligibility criteria described [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/) and have prepared a research proposal, click [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/application/research-api) to apply. 
  1. **Can I work with a group of researchers to collaborate on a research topic? How do I ensure we all get access to the Research Tools in order to collaborate on our approved project?**
We support lab-level access to Research Tools. The application form should be submitted by the project's principal researcher. Once the application is approved, the principal researcher can log in and view the approved "Organization" on the TikTok for Developers (TT4D) home page. Here, the principal researcher will have the ability to manage access, including adding and removing collaborators.
The principal researcher can add up to 9 collaborators to work together on a research topic. It is preferable that the principal researchers submit the details of all anticipated collaborators during the application process. TikTok will review any collaborators that are invited to join an approved research project prior to granting them access. Further, it is the responsibility of the principal researcher to remove and revoke access to collaborators who are no longer working on the approved research project.
If the collaborators are from a different research entity, an application should be submitted with a list of collaborators for each research entity.
The collaborators need to ensure that they have setup their TT4D account in advance prior to getting an invite.
The approved data limits will be shared across the organization.
  1. **When will TikTok's Research Tools be available in my country?**
TikTok is committed to supporting researchers and we hope to expand eligibility to additional regions soon. Please check this [page](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/) for updates.
  1. **I am a creator, advertiser, or commercial user. Am I eligible for access to the Research****Tools****?**
No. [Click here](https://developers.tiktok.com/) to learn more about our other API access opportunities.
Currently, the daily limit is set at 1000 requests per day, allowing you to obtain up to 100,000 records per day across our APIs. (Video and Comments API can return 100 records per request). The daily quota gets reset at 12 AM UTC. 
For the Followers and Following lists API, you can obtain up to 2M records per day by making up to 20,000 calls per day. You get a maximum of 100 records in each call. The daily quota gets reset at 12 AM UTC. 
If you are approved for access to the Virtual Compute Environment (VCE), then you can access up to 5,000 records per day in the "Test Stage". 
If you believe a quota limit increase is necessary for your research, please email us at Research-API@tiktok.com. We can't grant exceptions, but we're eager to better understand use cases from the research community to evaluate and take your requests into account for the future. 
  1. **I have a developer account with****TikTok****. Can I start using Research****Tools****?**
Your developer account alone is not sufficient to grant you access to Research Tools. In order to access our Research Tools, you will need to meet our eligibility requirements, submit an application, and be approved for a specific research project. 
## Research API Usage FAQs 
  1. **Why is my access token invalid?**
Access tokens are set to expire every two hours. If you experience an invalid token error within two hours of generating it, please submit a support ticket to us with your token and client key, and we will investigate the issue.
  1. **Why did I receive a response back with code: "scope_not_authorized" and message: "The user did not authorize the scope required for completing this request?"**
This indicates that you have not yet submitted your research application for our review and have not passed the necessary approval evaluations. If you are interested in accessing our Research Tools, visit our [Research ](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/)[Tools](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/)[](https://developers.tiktok.com/products/research-api/)page to learn more, check eligibility requirements and apply for access. 
  1. **Why is the query video data (view_count, comment_count, like_count, share_count) significantly inaccurate, often showing lower numbers than what is live at the moment?**
The User info API only retrieves data for an individual user, so we use online data. However, the video query API searches for the full dataset, so we use archived data instead of the current online data. New videos take up to 48 hours to be added to the search engine, and statistics such as view count and follower count can take up to 10 days to update.

                    ## 📄 `https-developers-tiktok-com-doc-research-api-get-started-enter-method-left-navigation-2f.md`
                    ```md
                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/research-api-get-started?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# Getting Started
This guide will show you how to use the Research API. Learn how to use the Research API to query video data and fetch public TikTok account data in the following use case example.
# View your client registration
Once your application is approved, a research client will be generated for your project. You can view your approved research projects [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/research/). Select a project from the list to see the research client details.
The provided **Client key** and **Client secret** are required to connect to the Research API endpoints. The client key and secret are hidden by default but can be displayed by clicking the **Display** button (eye icon).
The client secret is a credential used to authenticate your connection to TikTok's APIs. Do not share this with anyone!
# Obtain a client access token
Once you have obtained the client key and secret for your project, [generate a client access token](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/client-access-token-management). Add this access token in the authorization header of the http requests to connect to the Research API endpoints.
# Query TikTok public content data
The cURL command below shows an example of how you can query the TikTok ID and like count of videos created in the US or Canada with the keyword `hello world` in the video description. 
```
curl -X POST \
'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/research/video/query/?fields=id,like_count' \
  -H 'authorization: bearer clt.example12345Example12345Example' \
  -d '{ 
          "query": {
              "and": [
                   { "operation": "IN", "field_name": "region_code", "field_values": ["US", "CA"] },
                   { "operation": "EQ", "field_name": "keyword", "field_values": ["hello world"] }
               ]
          }, 
          "start_date": "20220615",
          "end_date": "20220628",
          "max_count": 10
}'
```
## Query condition
Similar to the WHERE clause in SQL, a condition can be used to filter data returned in a query operation. The above request is equivalent to the following SQL query: 
```
SELECT id,like_count FROM video_table WHERE region_code IN ["US", "CA"] AND create_date >20220615
```
**Key** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required?**  
---|---|---|---|---  
field_name | string | The field name this condition is restricting | "region_code" | TRUE  
operation | string | The comparison logic of this condition. One of: "EQ", "IN", "GT", "GTE", "LT", "LTE" | "GT" | TRUE  
field_values | list[string] | A list of values to be compared with | ["US", "IN"] | TRUE  
Note: approximate string matching (or fuzzy string searching) is used to match conditions.
### field_name
The following are the `field_name` values:
  * `keyword`
  * `create_date`
  * `username`
  * `region_code`
  * `video_id`
  * `hashtag_name`
  * `music_id`
  * `effect_id`
  * `video_length`
### operation
The following are the `operation` values:
`IN`: Tests if an expression matches any value in a list of values.`EQ`: Tests if an expression matches the specified value.`GT`: Tests if an expression is strictly greater than the specified value.`GTE`: Tests if an expression is greater than or equal to the specified value.`LT`: Tests if an expression is strictly less than the specified value.`LTE`: Tests if an expression is less than or equal to the specified value.
### AND, OR or NOT
Conditions are grouped by the following boolean operators:
`AND`: Displays a record if all the conditions separated by `AND` are `TRUE`.`OR`: Displays a record if any of the conditions separated by `OR` is `TRUE`.`NOT`: Displays a record if all the conditions separated by `NOT` are `FALSE`.
## Pagination
If the total number of videos that match the query criteria is larger than the max number of videos that can be returned in a single request, the response data will be returned with different requests.
**Field** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required?**  
---|---|---|---|---  
max_count | number | The max count of TikTok videos in response. default: 10, max: 100 | 12 |  FALSE   
cursor | number | The starting index of TikTok videos in response. default: 0 | 100 | FALSE  
search_id | string | The ID of a previous search to provide sequential calls for paging | "7167072234702738478" | FALSE  
### First page
When you send the first request, you do not need to set the `search_id` or `cursor` in the request body. In the http response, `cursor` and `search_id` are returned, which are used in the subsequent requests.

# Scopes Overview
Scopes represent end user granted permissions to access specific data resources or perform specific actions. Every TikTok for Developer API requires a scope to be accessed, and sensitive fields are protected by additional scopes. For example, the scope `user.info``.basic` allows access to APIs and data related to the basic user of a TikTok user.
## Managing scopes
Scopes are available on your app page. The scope `user.info``.basic` will be added by default for all apps with Login Kit. Developers can also request additional scopes and manage existing scopes on their app page after logging in.
To add scopes to your app, do the following: 
  1. Navigate to the section titled **Scopes** to view your scopes.
  2. Click the **Add Scopes** button, then add your desired scopes. 
To remove a scope, click the minus button next to it. 
Note: Remember that applying and being approved for a scope alone does not give you access to a user's data. Each user must also authorize your app for access to specific scopes.
## User authorization
After you are approved for certain scopes on TikTok for Developers, users will be asked to authorize and confirm your access. This is explained further in the tutorials for Login Kit on [iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-ios-login-kit-with-objective-c), [Android](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-android), [Desktop](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-desktop), and [Web](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-web). Users can grant or deny the requested scopes or any subset of them, and revoke the authorization at any time on their TikTok apps.
After a user grants the requested scopes, a code will be sent to your registered callback URL. You can obtain an `access_token` and start invoking TikTok for Developers APIs to get that user's information or perform actions on the user's behalf.
See how to [manage user access tokens](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens) for `access_token` related endpoints.

You can find the list of available scopes and their explanation on [the scopes reference page](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-scopes).

# Share Kit for Android
### Overview
Share Kit, part of our OpenSDK, enables third party apps to integrate directly with TikTok, providing creator's an ability to edit photos and videos in apps they love and seamlessly share content to TikTok. Using Share Kit and adding TikTok to your app's share sheet has these additional benefits:
  * Ease of use in integrating with TikTok as we provide the boilerplate code in this guide. Seamless sharing straight from your app's sharesheet.
  * Include your app's hashtag in content shared to TikTok. By engaging with the TikTok SDK, third party platforms will not only provide a new channel for their users to share their creations, but also expand the reach of their own platform through specified**partner hashtags** , as shown in the user journey below.
  * We show a toast to creators to return to your app after sharing content to TikTok. 
  * Third party apps can leverage creative effects such as sharing a single image or video as a [green screen background](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/green-screen-kit/).
This guide demonstrates how to enable sharing videos and images from your app to TikTok.
### Prerequisites
Before sharing videos to TikTok from your app, you must complete all the steps in [Android Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-android-quickstart).
Obtain the `client_key` located in the **Appdetails** section of your app on the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/). Then add Share Kit to your app by navigating to the **Manage apps** page, and clicking **+ Add products**.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/6488b2520fd74e5f2dce77c5aae9f9fc)
### Send a share request
  1. Create a `ShareApi` to send a share request.
  2. Build share content for images and videos into the `MediaContent` model.
  3. Create a `ShareRequest` object and set the required parameters. You can use the `shareFormat` field in the share request object to share images or videos with TikTok in different formats.
    1. `Format.DEFAULT`: The default share format. This format allows your app to share images or videos, as is, with TikTok.
    2. `Format.GREEN_SCREEN`: See [Green Screen](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/green-screen-kit) for more details.
  4. Call the `Share()` method in `ShareApi` .
```
/* Step 1 */shareApi = ShareApi(
    activity = [your_activity],
)
/* Step 2 */val mediaContent = MediaContent(
    mediaType = if (isSharingImage) MediaType.IMAGE else MediaType.VIDEO, 
    mediaPaths = mediaUrls, // a list of selected media paths)
// use Share.Format.GREEN_SCREEN for green screen share and Share.Format.DEFAULT for default shareval shareFormat = shareFormat = if (greenScreenEnabled) { 
    Format.GREEN_SCREEN
} else {
    Format.DEFAULT
}
/* Step 3 */val request = ShareRequest(
    clientKey = clientKey,
    mediaContent = mediaContent,
    shareFormat = shareFormat,
    packageName = [package name of your activity which will receive share result intent from TikTok, e.g com.bytedance.sdk.demo.share],
    resultActivityFullPath = [full classpathofyouractivitywhichwillreceiveshareresultintentfromTikTok, e.g com.bytedance.sdk.demo.share.ShareActivity])
/* Step 4 */shareApi.share(request);
```
If you want to share a file with the `file:///``content://`
Make sure you also grant TikTok access permission to your content Uri:
```
context.grantUriPermission("com.zhiliaoapp.musically", your_content_uri, 
    Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION)
context.grantUriPermission("com.ss.android.ugc.trill", your_content_uri, 
    Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION)
```
After a successful sharing session, a dialog will prompt the user to either go back to their app or stay in TikTok. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/3446607a62a44be1bfc2340e9d03d6b0)
If you want to receive callbacks when users stay in TikTok, register to receive a broadcast.
### Receive callbacks
Provide the package name and the activity full path in the `ShareRequest` and then the response will be sent to your activity.
Make sure you have set `android:exported="true"` for your activity so that it can receive messages from sources outside its application.
```
<activity
    android:name="You activity which is gonna receive the sharing result intent from TikTok"    ....
    android:exported="true">
</activity>
```
Parse `ShareResponse` from `intent` with `ShareApi.getShareResponseFromIntent`.
```
shareApi.getShareResponseFromIntent(intent)?.let { 
    val isSuccess = it.isSuccess
    val errorCode = it.errorCode
    val subErrorCode = it.subErrorCode
    val errorMsg = it.errorMsg
}
```
### Requirements for media
  * For video sharing: 
    * The minimum video duration is 1 second.
    * The maximum video duration is 360 seconds.
    * The supported video media type is `.mp4`.
    * The maximum frame size is 1100 px.
    * For multi-videos, the maximum number of videos is 35.
  * For image sharing: 
    * The number of images should be more than 1 and up to 35.
  * For green screen sharing:
    * The number of images and videos should only be 1.
  * You must be authorized to use any brand logos and watermarks. See 
### Error handling
If you receive an error sharing response, refer to the table below for error handling and debugging.

# **Share with TikTok by using Intents**
Developers can use Intent to share content with TikTok without using our Share Kit. However, using our Share Kit to share content provides additional benefits for our partners and their users with ease of use as mentioned [above](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/share-kit-android-quickstart-v2?enter_method=left_navigation%2F#overview).
## **Overview**
This guide details how to enable sharing from your app to TikTok by using a intents. TikTok supports sharing video, multi-video and multi-image currently.
## **Sharing on Android**
For all types of sharing, create an intent to send simple data to TikTok:
  * Set `Intent.ACTION_SEND`/`ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE` for Intent's action.
  * Set the appropriate MIME type. For example `image/*` for sharing images and `video/mp4` for sharing video.
  * Place a URI / a list of URIs pointing to the content in the extra `EXTRA_STREAM`.
Here is the example for sharing single-video:
```
val intent = Intent()
intent.action = Intent.ACTION_SEND
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, uriToImage)
intent.type = "video/*"yourActivity.startActivityForResult(intent, resultCode)
```
Sharing multi-image:
```
val imageUris = mutableListOf<Uri>()
imageUris.add(imageUri1) // Add your image URIs hereimageUris.add(imageUri2)
...
val intent = Intent()
intent.action = Intent.ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, imageUris)
intent.type = "image/*"shareIntent.setType("image/*")
yourActivity.startActivityForResult(intent, resultCode)
```
  * Note: When sharing multi-image with TikTok, TikTok will make a slideshow.
Sharing multi-video:
```
val videoUris = mutableListOf<Uri>()
videoUris.add(videoUri1) // Add your video URIs herevideoUris.add(videoUri2)
...
val intent = Intent()
intent.action = Intent.ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE
intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, videoUris)
shareIntent.setType("video/mp4")
yourActivity.startActivityForResult(intent, resultCode)
```
  * Note: When sharing multi-video with TikTok, TikTok will stitch into a long video. Users can edit the long video in TikTok.
If your shared images or videos are stored in internal storage of your app, then other apps can not access your files. When you want to share files with TikTok, you should grant permissions for these files by calling 
`intent.flag = Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`
## **PackageName for TikTok**
If you don't want to call Intent.createChooser(). You can set packageName to share directly to TikTok.
```
String TIKTOK_M_PACKAGE = "com.zhiliaoapp.musically";
String TIKTOK_T_PACKAGE = "com.ss.android.ugc.trill";
...//set packagenameshareIntent.setPackage(TikTokConstant.Share.TIKTOK_M_PACKAGE);
shareIntent.setPackage(TikTokConstant.Share.TIKTOK_T_PACKAGE);
```

# Share Kit for iOS
This guide explains how to integrate your app with Share Kit. Long videos with a duration of up to ten minutes can be shared. The allowed duration may vary based on the region. 
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, you must complete all the steps in [iOS Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-ios-quickstart).
Obtain the `client_key` located in the **App** **details** section of your app on the [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/). Then add Share Kit to your app by navigating to the **Manage apps** page, and clicking **+ Add products**.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/6488b2520fd74e5f2dce77c5aae9f9fc)
Your app must have access to the user's photo library to successfully share videos to TikTok.
## Create a share request and handle responses
For the following steps, your app is required to maintain a strong reference to the request to receive the response callback. You can discard it once you have handled the response.
  1. Start the share by calling the `send(_:)` method on the share request object.
  2. After the user finishes sharing, you will receive a response callback in the closure. In the share response object, you can find whether the share succeeded or failed.
```
/* Step 1 */import TikTokOpenShareSDK
let shareRequest =TikTokShareRequest(localIdentifiers: [...], 
                                      mediaType: .video, 
                                      redirectURI: "https://www.example.com/path")
/* Step 2 */shareRequest.send { response in/* Step 3 */let shareResponse = response as?TikTokShareResponseelse { return }
if shareResponse.errorCode == .noError {
print("Share succeeded!")
    } else {
print("Share Failed! 
               Error Code: \(shareResponse.errorCode.rawValue)               Error Message: \(shareResponse.errorMessage ??"")               Share State: \(shareResponse.shareState)")
    }
}
```
Alternatively, you can pass in a `nil` completion handler to the share request and create a `TikTokShareResponse` directly from the URL sent back by TikTok in the `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` AppDelegate function. In this case, you do not have to maintain a strong reference to the authorization request.
After a successful sharing session, a dialog will prompt the user to either go back to their app or stay in TikTok.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/f2a03b87439d9a115904194bbf656375)
## Share formats 
You can use the `shareFormat` field in the share request object to share images or videos to TikTok in different formats. If `shareFormat` is not set, it will be `.normal` by default
  * `.normal`: The default share format. This format allows your app to share images or videos, as is, to TikTok. 
  * `.greenScreen`: See [Green Screen](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/green-screen-kit) for more details.
* * *
Note:
  * The aspect ratio of images or videos should be between 1/2.2 and 2.2.
  * A maximum of 35 images can be shared.
  * A maximum of 12 videos can be shared.
  * You must be authorized to use any TikTok brand logos and watermarks. See 
## Handling errors
When an error occurs, the response will have an error code with the following mapping:
**Error Code** | **Description**  
---|---  
0 | Shared success.  
-1 | Common error type e.g. network error.  
-2 | User Canceled share in TikTok.  
-3 | User publish content failed.  
-4 | Share denied.  
-5 | Unsupported.  
Below is a mapping of the `shareState` which provides a more detailed explanation of the error:

# What's New
## New Request and Response Format
### Authentication
Users need to pass the access token returned from the authorization step to successfully call our APIs. The access token must be put into `Authorization` header with `Bearer` type. We no longer require `open_id` for request authentication.
### Request Parameters
`GET` requests may have query parameters but no request body is allowed.
For `POST` requests, `fields` should be provided as a query parameter. All other parameters should be placed in the request body in JSON format.
Please refer to the documentation for each individual API for detailed information about the request format.
### Error Handling
New APIs will return different `4xx` and `5xx` HTTP status in the response, with the name of the error and an error message in the response body. For a complete list of HTTP status and error names, please refer to our [new ](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-error-handling)[API Error Handling document](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-error-handling)[ation](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-error-handling).

                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-v2-rate-limit?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# Rate Limits on API Requests
TikTok API limits the number of requests you can send in a given timeframe. Limits for each API are set and enforced separately. Default limits are provided below. 
**API** | **Limit**  
---|---  
/v2/user/info/ | 600  
/v2/video/query/ | 600  
/v2/video/list/ | 600  
Request rate calculation is based on a one minute sliding window. If the number of requests exceeds the threshold, new requests will be throttled and a response will be returned with HTTP status `429` and error code `rate_limit_exceeded`.
If your application needs higher limits, please contact us using our [Support Page](https://developers.tiktok.com/support/). We will review your request. If approved, rate limits will be increased.

                    ## 📄 `https-developers-tiktok-com-doc-vce-getting-started-enter-method-left-navigation-2f.md`
                    ```md
                    # https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/vce-getting-started?enter_method=left_navigation%2F
# Getting Started
This guide shows you how to access and use the Virtual Compute Environment (VCE), a secure space that allows you to query and analyze public data. 
# How does the Virtual Compute Environment work?
The VCE allows you to access and analyze TikTok's public data in two stages. These stages are meant to protect user privacy and help organize your data analysis. 
  1. **Test Stage** : Query the data using TikTok's query software development kit (SDK). The VCE will return random sample data based on your query, limited to 5,000 records per day. The data here is limited to data of users who have at-least 25,000 followers. 
  2. **Execution Stage** : Submit a script to execute against all public data. TikTok provides a powerful search capability that allows data to be paginated in increments of up to 100,000 records. TikTok will review the results file to make sure the output is **aggregated**. 
    1. **NOTE** : Please ensure that the scripts submitted are looking to get aggregated outputs. Scripts that request individual data will be rejected. 
    2. Examples of Acceptable Outputs:
      1. Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, skewness, etc.)
      2. Inferential statistics (e.g., Z-scores, regression coefficients, etc.)
      3. Topic model results or word clouds
Note: TikTok only reviews the results to ensure that there is no identifiable individual information extracted out of the platform. All aggregated results will be shared as a downloadable link to the approved primary researcher's email.
# View your client registration
Once your application is approved, a research client will be generated for your project. You can view your approved research projects on your **[Research projects](https://developers.tiktok.com/research/)**[ page](https://developers.tiktok.com/research/). Select a project from the list to view the research client details.
The provided **Client key** and **Client secret** are required to access the VCE. The client key and secret are hidden by default but can be displayed by clicking the **Display** button (eye icon).
Note: The client secret is a credential used to authenticate your connection to TikTok's Research Tools. Do not share this with anyone!
# Log in to the Virtual Compute Environment
First, go to the [Virtual Compute Environment login page](https://research.tiktok.com/virtual-compute-environment/hub/). 
Then, sign in using your **Client key** as the **Username** and your **Client secret** as the **Password**. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/6be5ab005c392bdb522dfced6c90671c)
# Use the Virtual Compute Environment
## Test Stage: Query TikTok's public data
In the Test Stage, you will submit a query to access random sample public data about videos, comments, and users. You can retrieve up to 5000 records per day from creators who have at least 25,000 followers. 
Note: If you want to analyze all public user data, you must submit a script to the VCE, as explained later in this guide. 
### Install query SDK
After logging into the VCE, click the **New Launcher** [**+**] button. Then open a new notebook, choosing the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** option.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/1ce634178211ef886fad4769d44b2228)
Copy and paste the following code into the terminal, then run the code to install the query SDK from TikTok.
```
!pip install \
-U --index-url https://us-west2-python.pkg.dev/research-platform-prod/jupyterlab-extensions-prod/simple/ \pyrqs
```
### Set query parameters 
You must structure your query according to the following guidelines. Use the query structure example code below as a framework for formatting your query. 
#### Data category 
Indicate what `category` of data you want to query. The available data categories are described in the respective reference pages:
  * [Query Profiles](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/vce-query-profiles/)
  * [Query Videos](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/vce-query-videos/)
  * [Query Video Comments](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/vce-query-video-comments/)
#### Condition groups
Create your query `condition_groups` using the listed field names, operations, and boolean operators. 
**Field names**
The following are the `field_name` values:
  * `keyword`
  * `create_time`
  * `display_name`
  * `region_code`
  * `id`
  * `video_description`
  * `hashtag_name`
  * `music_id`
  * `like_count`
  * `comment_count`
  * `share_count`
  * `view_count`
  * `effect_ids`
  * `hashtag_names`
  * `playlist_id`
  * `voice_to_text`
  * `duration_type`
  * `video_length`
**Operations**
The following are the `operation` values:
  * `IN`: Tests if an expression matches any value in a list of values
  * `EQ`: Tests if an expression matches the specified value
  * `GT`: Tests if an expression is strictly greater than the specified value
  * `GTE`: Tests if an expression is greater than or equal to the specified value
  * `LT`: Tests if an expression is strictly less than the specified value
  * `LTE`: Tests if an expression is less than or equal to the specified value
  * `LIKE`: Available for video_description, returns the rows if it contains a specified value
  * `CONTAINS`: Available for `effect_ids` and `hashtag_names`, returns the rows if they contain the specified `effect_ids` or `hashtag_names`
**Boolean operators**
Conditions are grouped by the following boolean operators:
  * `AND`: Displays a record if all the conditions separated by `AND` are `TRUE`
  * `OR`: Displays a record if any of the conditions separated by `OR` is `TRUE`
  * `NOT`: Displays a record if all the conditions separated by `NOT` are `FALSE`
#### Fields, limit, and client
Specify the `fields` to be returned in the query results, and a `limit` indicating the maximum number of records to return. Create a `client`, such as RQSClient, to interact with the query service.
### Query structure example
Below is a complete sample command that can be executed in the VCE. This example defines a data variable and prints the data received by the query to display it on the VCE. 
**Example code**
```
from pyrqs import rqs
category = 'video'condition_groups = [
    {
"operator": "and",
"conditions": [
            {
"field": "like_count",
"operator": "gte",
"field_values": ["10"]
            }
        ]
    }
]
fields = 'display_name,video_description,create_time,id'limit = 10
client = rqs.RQSClient()
data = client.query(
            category=category, condition_groups=condition_groups, fields=fields, limit=limit)
print(data)
```
The data from this sample code should be displayed on the VCE, as below.

## Execution Stage: Submit script to analyze data 
After you have queried the data and understood the metadata structure, you can run a script to analyze all TikTok's public data. Please make sure that the output of your script at this stage does not contain individual-level data.
To submit a script to the VCE, do the following: 
  1. Click the shield icon on the right sidebar.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/6306f0d85ff6f597394a84ddeee772be)
  1. Select your script file in the right sidebar, then click the upload button. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/6c09fdf6995fe3236f4e408d2ac30eb2)
  1. When prompted to submit a job to Data Clean Room, click the **Ok** button. 
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/ed65026d242a796fa165c9f33e672e78)
  1. Once submitted, your script will run in a trusted execution environment to analyze and prepare the results file.
  2. TikTok will review the results to verify that results are aggregated and do not contain individual data. 
  3. After the results are verified, TikTok will send an email to the primary researcher to download the approved results file.

**Key** | **Type** | **Description** | **Example** | **Required**  
---|---|---|---|---  
category   
| string | The data category for which the analysis is planned. As the scripting language is the same across various data categories, this value will help determine what data to fetch.  |  tiktok_shop_info   
| Yes  
condition_groups   
|  object   
|  Specifications for what data should be used for querying.   

| condition_groups = [

---|---|---|---|---  
category   
| string | The data category for which the analysis is planned. As the scripting language is the same across various data categories, this value will help determine what data to fetch.  |  tiktok_shop_info   
| Yes  
condition_groups   
|  object   
|  Specifications for what data should be used for querying.   

| condition_groups = [

# Android Support for FileProvider
## Getting started
## Step 1: Integrate the fileprovider SDK
```
// Add the following to gradle：repositories {
    maven { 
        url 'https://dl.bintray.com/aweme-open-sdk-team/public'    }
} 
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.bytedance.ies.ugc.aweme:opensdk-oversea-external:0.1.4.1'}
```
## Step 2: Integration
  1. In the Application onCreate，initialize TikTokOpenApiFactory
```
@OverridepublicvoidonCreate(){
super.onCreate();
    String clientkey = "[Client Key]";
    TikTokOpenApiFactory.init(new TikTokOpenConfig(clientkey));
}
```
  1. Add permissions to your Android Manifest, and setup callback to your activity
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
// If you have a custom activity to receive callback, you can skip this step<activity     android:name=".tiktokapi.TikTokEntryActivity"  android:launchMode="singleTask"  android:taskAffinity="[Your package name]"  android:exported="true">
</activity>
```
TikTok 12.5.0 and above supports FileProvider. Below are the instructions to support FileProvider.
## FileProvider Usage
  1. Settings
In your app's AndroidManifest.xml, add the following settings as follows:
```
<provider  android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"  android:authorities="${applicationPackageName}.fileprovider"  android:exported="false"  android:grantUriPermissions="true">
  <meta-data
    android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"    android:resource="@xml/file_provider_paths" />
</provider>
```
In res/xml (please create the directory if it doesn't exist), add a file file_provider_paths.xml with the content:
```
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <external-files-path name="sharedata" path="shareData/"/>
</paths>
```
external-files-path represents the files in the root of your app's external storage area. The root path of this subdirectory is the same as the value returned by Context.getExternalFilesDir(null)
You can also support other paths for example:
```
<files-path name="name" path="path" /> // Subdirectory returned by Context.getFilesDir()<cache-path name="name" path="path" /> // Subdirectory returned by Contextget.CacheDir()
```
For more information, check out this 
  1. Using the FileProvider API
FileProvider converts a path file a content://URI format
```
public String getFileUri(Context context){
     String filePath = context.getExternalFilesDir(null).p + "/shareData/test.png";
// The filePath needs conforms to the path in the xml/file_provider_path file in order to be sharable    File file = new File(filePath);
// Use contentPath for sharing    String contentPath = getFileUri(context, file);
// The package name here must be consistent with what was provided in the AndroidManifest.xml's authorities.    Uri contentUri = FileProvider.getUriForFile(context, 
"com.example.app.fileprovider",file);
// Authorize permission for TikTok build variants    context.grantUriPermission("com.zhiliaoapp.musically",  
        contentUri, Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
    context.grantUriPermission("com.ss.android.ugc.trill",  
        contentUri, Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
return contentUri.toString(); // contentUri.toString() should be prefixed with "content://"}
```
  1. Sharing photos
```
TiktokOpenApi tiktokOpenApi = TikTokOpenApiFactory.create(this);
if (tiktokOpenApi.isShareSupportFileProvider() &&
        android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.N) {
    ArrayList<String> images = new ArrayList<>();
    images.add(xxx);  // Pass FileProvider formatted list here    Share.Request request = new Share.Request();
    ImageObject imageObject = new ImageObject();
    imageObject.mImagePaths = images;
    MediaContent mediaContent = new MediaContent();
    mediaContent.mMediaObject = imageObject;
    request.mMediaContent = mediaContent;
    tiktokOpenApi.share(request);
} else {
    Toast.makeText(TestFileProviderActivity.this, "Unsupported version", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
```
  1. Sharing videos
```
if (tiktokOpenApi.isShareSupportFileProvider() &&
        android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.N) {
    ArrayList<String> videos = new ArrayList<>();
    videos.add("video path"); // Pass FileProvider formatted list here    Share.Request request = new Share.Request();
    VideoObject videoObject = new VideoObject();
    videoObject.mVideoPaths = videos;
    MediaContent content = new MediaContent();
    content.mMediaObject = videoObject;
    request.mMediaContent = content;
    tiktokOpenApi.share(request);
} else {
    Toast.makeText(TestFileProviderActivity.this, "Unsupported version", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
```

There is a new version of this SDK: [Share Kit for Android](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/share-kit-android-quickstart-v2)
# Video Kit with Android
### Overview
This guide details how to enable sharing from your app to TikTok. After sharing successfully to TikTok, users will see your app's name in TikTok feed.
> Note: The minimum TikTok version supporting sharing is 11.3.0.
Now we support long video sharing (> 1min) for up to 10 mins. Actual supported video duration may vary based on region. 
### Prerequisites
Before you can share to TikTok from your App, make sure you have obtained a Client Key from TikTok and installed the TikTok SDK to your Android project. For details on these requirements, see Getting started.
We recommend that developers targeting Android 7.0 and above use FileProvider to share. For more details, please refer to the [document](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/video-kit-android-android-fileprovider).
### Detailed Steps
Follow the steps mentioned in the [Quickstart Guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-android-quickstart)
#### Send Share Request
  1. Create a `TiktokOpenApi` to send share request.
  2. Build share content for images/videos into the `TikTokMediaContent` model.
  3. Create Share.Request instance and set required parameters: `request.mMediaContent = [TikTokMediaContent]`.
  4. Call method `Share()` in `TiktokOpenApi` .
```
// 1.create TiktokOpenApiTiktokOpenApi tiktokOpenApi= TikTokOpenApiFactory.create(this);
Share.Request request = new Share.Request();
// initialize the resource path, please provide absolute pathArrayList<String> mUri = new ArrayList<>();
mUri.add ...
// 2.build share content for photos/videos into TikTokMediaContentVideoObject videoObject = new VideoObject();
videoObject.mVideoPaths = mUri;
MediaContent content = new MediaContent();
content.mMediaObject = videoObject;
// 3.set required parametersrequest.mMediaContent = content;
// or share multi-picture，here the size of mUri must >=2ImageObject imageObject = new ImageObject();
imageObject.mImagePaths = mUri;
MediaContent mediaContent = new MediaContent();
mediaContent.mMediaObject = imageObject;
request.mMediaContent = mediaContent;
// 4.start sharetiktokOpenApi.share(request);
```
After a successful sharing session, a Dialog will prompt for the user to choose `Back to your App` or `Stay in TikTok`.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/2deed5c9adde5fd043a8294169c5f39e)
If you want to receive callbacks when people stay in TikTok , please register to receive a broadcast :
**Parameters in Share.Request**
**Parameter** | **Usage**  
---|---  
mMediaContent | You can build share content for videos or photos using following models: 1. multi-Image: see `ImageObject`model. Note: The size of Images must be > 1 and <= 12. 2. single-video\multi-video: see `VideoObject`model. Then assign required parameter as `request.mMediaContent = [MediaContent]`;  
callerLocalEntry | Set customized callback Activity by using `request.callerLocalEntry = "com.xxx.xxx...activity";` If this parameter is not set, TikTok will callback `TikTokEntryActivity` in default.  
#### Receive Callbacks
We provides two ways for you to receive the callback data from TikTok.
  1. Create new activity named "TikTokEntryActivity" in your app and implement TikTokApiEventHandler interface.
**Note** : The path of the activity should be your "package name" + .tiktokapi.TikTokEntryActivity. For example, "com.tiktok.opensdk.tiktokapi.TikTokEntryActivity".
The following example shows how to use TikTokEntryActivity to receive the callback data.
```
classTikTokEntryActivityextendsActivityimplementsIApiEventHandler{
   TiktokOpenApi ttOpenApi;
@OverridepublicvoidonCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState){
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       ttOpenApi= TikTokOpenApiFactory.create(this);
       ttOpenApi.handleIntent(getIntent(),this); // receive and parse callback   }
@OverridepublicvoidonReq(BaseReq req){
   }
@OverridepublicvoidonResp(BaseResp resp){
if (resp.getType() == TikTokConstants.ModeType.SHARE_CONTENT_TO_TT_RESP)  {
           Share.Response response = (Share.Response) resp;
           Toast.makeText(this, " code：" + response.errorCode + " errorMessage：" + response.errorMsg, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
       }
   }
@OverridepublicvoidonErrorIntent(@Nullable Intent intent){
       Toast.makeText(this, "Intent Error", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
   }
}
```
  1. You can also customize your own activity to receive the callback; just implement the interface `IApiEventHandler` and set your activity path by using parameter "callerLocalEntry".
### Requirements for Media
  * For Video: 
    * Minimum video duration must be 3 seconds.
    * Supported video media type: .mp4.
    * The minimum of the frame size should be no more than 1100.
  * For multi-Video: 
    * The number of Videos can be no more than 12.
  * For multi-Image: 
    * The number of images should be more than 1 and up to 12.
  * Videos cannot contain brand logos or watermarks. Violating this guideline will lead to videos being deleted or accounts being banned. Make sure your applications share content without watermarks or brand logos.

# Video Kit with Objective-C
There is a new version of this SDK: [Share Kit for iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/share-kit-ios-quickstart-v2)
## Introduction
Video Kit allows users to share videos and photos from your app to TikTok. Make sure your app has access to Photo Library.
Now we support long video sharing (> 1min) for up to 10 mins. Actual supported video duration may vary based on region. 
## Preparation
Before you start sharing, you need to complete all of the configurations listed in [Getting Started](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-ios-quickstart-objective-c) with the TikTok SDK for iOS.
You can complete the sharing step by step：
### Step 1 : Import Header
Import TikTokOpenSDKShare.h
```
#import <TikTokOpenSDK/TikTokOpenSDKShare.h>
```
### Step 2 : Construct a Share Request
Construct a share request.
```
TikTokOpenPlatformShareRequest *req = [[TikTokOpenPlatformShareRequest alloc] init];
```
### Step 3 : Required Parameters
Set the shared resource type. Currently we support images and videos.
```
req.mediaType = TikTokOpenSDKShareMediaTypeImage;
//Orreq.mediaType = TikTokOpenSDKShareMediaTypeVideo;
```
Set share localIdentifiers as PHAsset.
e.g
```
NSMutableArray<NSString *> *mediaLocalIdentifiers = [NSMutableArray array];
for (PHAsset *asset inself.selectedAssets) {
    [mediaLocalIdentifiers addObject:asset.localIdentifier];
}
req.localIdentifiers = [mediaLocalIdentifiers copy];
```
> Note:
>   * The aspect ratio of the images or videos should between: [1/2.2, 2.2]
>   * If mediaType is Image: 
>     * The number of images should be more than one and up to 12.
>   * If mediaType is Video: 
>     * Total video duration should be longer than 1 seconds.
>     * No more than 12 videos can be shared
>     * Videos with brand logo or watermark will lead to the videos being deleted or the respective accounts disabled. Make sure your application shares content without a watermark.
> 
### Step 4 : Optional Parameters
**State**
You can customize a string to identify a share. The same state will be present in the respond.
You can bind you information with this ShareID.
```
req.state = @"a47e57c6c559acb88a9569da66ee5f65e0f779c9";
```
### Step 5 : Send Share Request
Call `-[``TikTokOpenSDKShareRequest`` sendShareRequestWithCompleteBlock:]` method to send the share request .
It will open the TikTok app and publish the content. Users can stay in TikTok or go back to your App after sharing.
If the user goes back to your app, you can receive a callback in CompleteBlock.
When any error happens, the response will have an error code with the following mapping:
**TikTokOpenSDKErrorCode** | **errorCode** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
TikTokOpenSDKSuccess | 0 | Shared success.  
TikTokOpenSDKErrorCodeCommon | -1 | Common error type e.g. network error.  
TikTokOpenSDKErrorCodeUserCanceled | -2 | User Canceled share in TikTok.  
TikTokOpenSDKErrorCodeSendFailed | -3 | User publish content failed.  
TikTokOpenSDKErrorCodeAuthDenied | -4 | Auth denied.  
TikTokOpenSDKErrorCodeUnsupported | -5 | Unsupported.  
If the error code does not make it easy for you to locate a specific error, you can use 'respond.shareState` for detail message. SDK version need 2.0.8 or higher.
The following map defines the Sharing state and specific issues.
**TikTokOpenSDKShareRespState** | **value** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
TikTokOpenSDKShareRespStateSuccess | 20000 | Success.  
TikTokOpenSDKShareRespStateUnknownError | 20001 | Unknown or current SDK version unclassified error.

# Video Kit with Swift
There is a new version of this SDK: [Share Kit for iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/share-kit-ios-quickstart-v2)
This guide explains how to integrate your app with Video Kit in Swift. Long videos with a duration of up to ten minutes can be shared. The allowed duration may vary based on the region. 
## Preparation
You are required to configure your app on [TikTok for Developers website](https://developers.tiktok.com/). See [Getting Started with TikTok SDK for iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-ios-quickstart-swift) for more information. 
Your app must have access to the user's photo library to successfully share videos to TikTok.
## Create a Share Request
Import the TikTokOpenShareSDK module and create a share request, as shown in the code snippet below.
> Your app object is required to maintain a strong reference to the request to successfully receive the response callback. You can discard it once you have handled the response. 
Set the following fields in the share request object:
  * `localIdentifiers`: List of media. Media can either be all videos or all images.
  * `mediaType`: The type of media you want to share.
  * `shareFormat`: Refer to the Share Formats section in this guide.
```
import TikTokOpenShareSDK
let shareRequest =TikTokShareRequest()
shareRequest.localIdentifiers = [...]
shareRequest.mediaType = .video
shareRequest.shareFormat = .normal
shareRequest.send { response inlet shareResponse = response as?TikTokShareResponseelse { return }
}
```
## Share Formats 
You can use the `shareFormat` field in the share request object to share images or videos to TikTok in different formats.
  1. `.normal`: The default share format. This format allows your app to share image(s) or video(s), as is, to TikTok. 
  2. `.greenScreen`: The green screen format provides a seamless experience for users to apply a video or image directly to the background of the green screen effect. Green screen videos use one video or image as the background and the creator's figure is in the front. 
    1. The green screen feature is supported only on TikTok version 25.0.0 and later.
    2. The `.greenScreen` field applies only when sharing a single video or single image. If multiple videos or images are shared, then the `shareFormat` field will be ignored. 
    3. If the application of the green screen effect fails on the TikTok app, the user is prompted to continue with regular sharing.
> **Note:**
>   * The aspect ratio of images or videos should be between: [1/2.2, 2.2]
>   * A maximum of 35 images can be shared.
>   * A maximum of 12 videos can be shared.
>   * You must be authorized to use any TikTok brand logos and watermarks. See 
>

### Constraints
To make sure the video can be shared successfully, the developer is responsible for uploading video files that meet the following expectations:
  * The size of the uploaded video file must be less than or equal to 50 MB.
  * The duration of the video file must be at least 3 seconds and at most 60 seconds.
  * The supported video file format is _MP4_.
  * The video resolution is at least 540p.
### Webhook
TikTok uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens to the shared video.
For more information about how to set up a webhook subscription, see [Webhooks Overview](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/webhooks-overview).
## Example Flow
  1. Make sure your users have authorized `video.upload` permissions to your application. This should be shown under the authorization page as a bullet that reads "Publish videos to TikTok".
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/7aa76741571a3c1d727efce88bd1dd11)
  1. Send a POST request to the share/video/upload endpoint.
Example Request
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://open-api.tiktok.com/share/video/upload/?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>&open_id=<OPEN_ID>' \
--form 'video=@"/Users/tiktok/Downloads/video.mp4"'
```
  1. Check to make sure you have received a successful response. With a successful response, you should see a notification show up in your inbox saying that your video has been sent to TikTok.
Example Successful Response
```
{
"data": {
"err_code": 0,
"error_code": 0,
"share_id": "v_inbox.<ID>"    },
"extra": {
"error_detail": "",
"logid": "<LOG_ID>"    }
}
```
Example Failed Response
```
{
"data": {
"err_code": 20002,
"error_code": 20002,
"error_msg": "The user did not authorize the scope required for completing this request."    },
"extra": {
"error_detail": "",
"logid": "<LOG_ID>"    }
}
```
Notification in inbox
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/tiktok-open-platform/ttop_doc_images/261967fe5e6d7ba34a8d3cf701d683df)
  1. After some time, another notification will appear in your inbox saying: "Your video from <APP> is ready: Edit your video before sharing to TikTok." Click this notification to proceed to edit and publish your video to TikTok. You may instead get another notification explaining that your video upload has failed. If this occurs, please check that your video meets the constraints outlined in the "Constraints" section above in this documentation and try uploading your video again.

# TikTok Webhooks
## Overview
Webhook is a subscription that notifies your application via a callback URL when an event happens in TikTok. Rather than requiring you to pull information via API, you can use webhooks to get information on events that occur. Notifications are delivered via HTTPS POST in JSON format to the callback url configured for your app in the Developer Portal. This information can be used to update your system or to trigger business processes.
## Requirements and Limitations
In order to receive a webhook message, callback URL should be registered in the client application on TikTok Developer Portal. This callback url can be configured either during the initial application or after the client key has been provisioned by updating the application.
The callback URL must do the following:
  * Immediately respond with a 200 HTTP status code to acknowledge the receipt of the event notification.
  * The callback URL endpoint must require HTTPS.
If a 200 HTTP status code is not returned, TikTok assumes that the delivery was unsuccessful. TikTok retries the delivery of event notification for up to 72 hours using exponential backoff. After 72 hours, the notification is discarded and not sent again.
TikTok makes a best effort for "at least once delivery" of webhooks. Webhook endpoints might receive the same event more than once. There should be a guard against duplicated event receipts by making your event processing idempotent.

# Check the signature
TikTok webhooks are sent with a signature the destination server can use to verify that the event came from TikTok and not a third party or malicious system. It is _strongly recommended_ that webhook consumers verify these signatures before processing each webhook event.
## Verify Message Signature
To protect your app against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks, you should verify the signature of messages sent to your application. Since this timestamp is part of the signed payload, an attacker cannot change the timestamp without invalidating the signature. If the signature is valid but the timestamp is too old, you can have your application reject the payload.
The signature is included as `TikTok-Signature` in the header.
### Example of TikTok-Signature
```
"Tiktok-Signature": "t=1633174587,s=18494715036ac4416a1d0a673871a2edbcfc94d94bd88ccd2c5ec9b3425afe66"
```
### Signature Verification
#### Step 1: Extract the timestamp and signatures from the header
Split the header, using the `,` character as the separator, to get a list of elements. Next, split each element, using the `=` character as the separator, to get a prefix and value pair.
The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp, and `s` corresponds to the signature.
#### Step 2: Signature Generation
`signed_payload` can be created by concatenating:
  * The timestamp as a string
  * The character `.`
  * The actual JSON payload (request body)
An HMAC with the SHA256 hash function is computed with your `client_secret` as the key and your `signed_payload` string as the message.
#### Step 3: Signature Generation
Compare the signature in the header to the generated signature. In the case they are equal, compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp in the header. Use this to decide whether the difference is tolerable.

# Working with organizations
## Introduction
Organizations allow developers to collaborate as a group. Using organizations, multiple developers can work together on registered apps in TikTok for Developers. 
Developers sign in with their TikTok for Developers account, create or join an organization for their company, department, or group, and then cooperate on their project. Individuals assigned as administrators can manage membership in the organization. 
### Who should use organizations?
If you work as part of a group of people, you should join or create an organization for your group. For example, employees of a company should register apps under the ownership of the organization and not under their individual accounts.
**Note** : Sharing developer accounts and login credentials is discouraged because of security, privacy, and business continuity concerns.
## Member Guide
### How do I view my organizations?
Navigate to the [My organizations](https://developers.tiktok.com/organizations) page by selecting **My organizations** from the Developer menu: the user icon on the top right of the page. Here you can see all the organizations you are a member of. Click on an organization to view its details.
### How do I join an organization?
To join an organization, you must be invited by an administrator. Once invited, an email will be sent to the email address registered with your TikTok developer account. You can also view and respond to pending invitations on the **My organizations** page.
If you accept the invitation to join an organization, you will be added to the organization. If you reject the invitation, you will not be added. If you change your mind and decide to join, the administrator will need to send you a new invitation. Please be careful before rejecting invitations as we limit the number of invitations administrators can send you.
### How do I leave an organization?
To leave an organization, first navigate to the organization page. Click the menu button (three dots: **...**) and select **Leave organization**. Confirm that you want to leave the organization.
If you leave an organization, you cannot join again without an invitation from an administrator. 
### How do I register an app directly with an organization? 
Follow the instructions described in [Register you app](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app). When prompted to select the app owner, choose one of your organizations from the list.
### How do I import an app into an organization?
Importing or transferring apps are irreversible actions. Only perform this action if you are certain you want to transfer ownership to the organization.
  1. Navigate to your app from the [Manage apps](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps/) page.
  2. Select an app which you own that you wish to import.
  3. Open the advanced management drop-down by clicking the three dots (**...**). 
  4. Click **Transfer App**.
  5. Select the desired organization, and click **Initiate Transfer**.
An invitation will be emailed to the administrators of the app to accept and complete the transfer.
Do not request to transfer apps to unauthorized organizations. The recipient organization should be the rightful owner of the app in the real world.
## Administrator Guide
### What is an organization administrator?
As an administrator or admin, you have full rights to manage the organization. You can invite developers, promote others to administrators, approve requests for apps to be imported from personal accounts, and even delete the whole organization.
Only assign the administrator role to those who require full control of the organization. However, it's recommended to have at least two admins in an organization to prevent issues when an admin leaves the organization.
### How do I create an organization?
Navigate to the [My organizations](https://developers.tiktok.com/organizations) page and click **Add organization**. Enter a name for your organization and click **Create**. Your organization will be created and you will be set as an administrator by default. 
**Note** : For research projects, do not create your own organization. An organization will be created for your project automatically upon approval. It is not possible to add research projects to your non-research organizations.
### How do I invite new members?
To invite a member to your organization, you must be an administrator for that organization.
  1. Navigate to your organization from the [My organizations](https://developers.tiktok.com/organizations) page. 
  2. Scroll down to the **Members** section.
  3. Click **Add member**.
  4. Enter the member’s email address. 
     * The developer must already have a registered account with TikTok for Developers. Sending invitations to unregistered developers is not supported. 
  5. Choose the right role for the invitee.
     * Admins have total control over the organization and its membership.
     * Members have access to the organization's resources (apps and research projects).
  6. Click **Send invitation**.
You can track your invitations in the **Members** section and cancel them if necessary. 
An organization may only have up to 10 members by default.
**Note** : For research projects, you will be asked additional questions and information about the invitees.
### How do I remove members from an organization?
To remove a member from your organization, you must be an administrator for that organization. 
  1. Navigate to your organization from the [My organizations](https://developers.tiktok.com/organizations) page. 
  2. Scroll down to the **Members** section.
  3. Find the member you want to remove.
  4. Click the three dots (**...**) button to show additional actions, and select **Remove**.
### How can I stop being an administrator for my organization?
Follow these steps to give up your administrative rights in an organization:
  1. Navigate to your organization from the [My organizations](https://developers.tiktok.com/organizations) page.
  2. Click the menu button (three dots: **...**) and select **Give up admin rights**. 
  3. Confirm that you want to give up admin rights.

Commercial Content API
TikTok is working towards enhancing transparency on advertisements presented on our platform. As part of our efforts, we have built commercial content related APIs that includes ads, ad and advertiser metadata, targeting information. Such advertisement-related data will be accessible for the period when the advertisement is run and until one year since the advertisement was last shown to any user.

What data will be available?With the Commercial Content APIs, the public and researchers can access public data on:
Paid Ads
This includes data on ads such as the published date, last seen date, targeting information, number of people who have seen the ad. We also share selected information on ads disapproved on the platform.
Advertiser
Other commercial content

Content Posting APIs are compatible with desktop, cloud, and web applications. Additionally, you can provide different posting options in your app by letting creators either post their content directly from your app to their TikTok profile or upload it to TikTok as a draft for further editing.
Our offerings
Direct Post API With Direct Post API, creators can post content directly from your app to their TikTok profile. Once integrated, your app will have the same posting settings as TikTok, so that creators can write a caption, add hashtags, and choose who can view their posted content.
Try it out
Upload to TikTok With Upload API, creators can upload draft content from your app to TikTok. Once their content has been successfully exported, they will receive a notification in their TikTok inbox informing them that their uploaded content is ready for further editing and can be posted through TikTok's creation flow.

Data Portability API
Effective data portability aligns with the ideas of market contestability that TikTok supports.  
Our Data Portability API, available for TikTok users in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), allows users to authorize a transfer of their information to your app. We're working to provide increased access to this API in the future.
View docs
What data is available?With the Data Portability API, users can designate your app to request and manage exports of different data scopes.
Posts and profile
Includes information about a user's profile like their posts, following list, and followers list.
Activity
Direct messages
All available data
For each of these sets of data, users can authorize a one-time request, or give permission for ongoing access. Learn more about the [data types](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/data-portability-data-types) returned by our APIs.
![](https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-va2/lapz_k4_rvarpa/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/products/data_portability/PostsTab.png)
Who can apply?
Our Data Portability API is available to qualified applicants globally, but currently only covers data for TikTok users in the EEA and UK.   
Applicants must fulfill the following criteria to qualify for access:
  * Have a well-defined use case that requires access to one or more of the listed scopes
  * Serve TikTok users in the EEA or UK and be able to distinguish them (the API will not return data for users outside the EEA or UK)
  * Provide high-fidelity UX mockups and pass a privacy and security review to ensure user safety

###  How does the TikTok For Business Affiliate Program work? 
The TikTok For Business Partner Program allows partners to earn a commission when driving new users to use TikTok For Business. All partners must apply and join the program through Impact. Your account will go through our standard approval process. Once accepted into the program, you will have access to promote TikTok for Business and can start earning a commission (a flat-fee bounty) on conversions that you drive through your website/social channels. In your Impact account, you will be able to create your own affiliate links that have unique tracking automatically tied to your account – this way, when a conversion comes through, the Impact system will attribute it to you.
###  How can I share my affiliate links? 
###  How do I receive payment? 
###  Is there any reporting I can see to monitor my affiliate performance? 
###  Is this the same program as TikTok Shop?

# TikTok Shop Operations Team: Bringing Discovery E-commerce to Life
TikTok Shop is unique in the world of online retail, being driven by the power of discovery e-commerce - the platform's ability to help users discover products they didn't even know they were looking for through social content! When it comes to delivering our seamless, one-stop shopping experience for sellers and shoppers, the TikTok Shop Operations team has a wide range of responsibilities.
From Zainab Shafique, who helps develop relationships with TikTok creators, to Sola Nathan, who manages product categories to help sellers find the right audience, to Alanna Essig, who works with agencies that provide many different services to grow businesses, Operations teammates have a direct relationship with merchants, partners, and creators. This unique position gives those who join the team a chance to develop an authentic, human connection with business owners and creators; something that sets us apart from other e-commerce platforms. Read on to find out why that drew each of them to the platform, and how it drives the countless ways Operations teammates are building the future of shopping on TikTok.
One way to achieve excellence in e-commerce is through dedicated support of different product categories. For Sola Nathan, a Category Manager based in London, it's all about accessories.
"I manage fashion accessories. So that's necklaces, rings, bracelets, watches, hair extensions, wigs." Other category managers look after beauty products, furniture, electronics, food, and more. The role of each manager is to make sure sellers in their category are educated on all the TikTok Shop functionalities available to them to maximize their growth and sales.
Using analytics and knowledge of product supply, category managers like Nathan help businesses with product uploads, catalog listings, pricing and deal strategy, creating content, and promotions like flash sales. They also coach businesses on how to create strategic content that best fits the businesses' needs.
"We all have the autonomy and trust to develop the best strategy for our category. I have a lot more scope and flexibility here to kind of drive my own initiatives for accessories, than I had at previous jobs."
"TikTok Shop is all about empowering SMBs," he adds. "I've seen first-hand people leave their 9 to 5 corporate jobs to go full-time selling on TikTok Shop. They change their lives and their families' lives. Anyone can go viral on TikTok Shop as long as they have good products and content strategy. I'm very proud that the Operations team can help make that happen."  
![](https://lifeattiktok.com/blog)
Alanna Essig also works to elevate businesses on the platform. As the first TikTok Shop Partner hire, Essig helped shape the agency ecosystem that takes brands and merchants to the next level, integrating traditional sales with TikTok's vast and highly engaged communities.
"Because growing a business through a content platform is a new frontier, many sellers need assistance on how to best leverage their assets in order to grow," she says. "I match sellers with partners/agencies that will best help with content creation for their business." This includes providing any type of service a seller might need to grow their business, such as shop management, creating shopping ads, and Live Shopping.
"When you think about traditional e-commerce marketplaces, it's very search-driven. Shoppers have to go in with an intention, and know exactly what they're looking for," she adds. TikTok Shop, however, is different. "For our platform, it's all about discovery. So we find service providers that promote discovery and content at scale, and that's very different from any other marketplace provider today." She is passionate about how fast TikTok Shop is growing - when she joined the team, the first year it launched in the United States, "nobody in my life even knew TikTok Shop existed!"  
The team doesn't only work with shops and partners; they make sure creators have a positive experience on the platform as well. As an Ascending Creator Manager, Zainab Shafique looks at creator development and helps them come up with a strategy to flourish. In addition to answering queries and helping these creators understand how best to use and benefit from the TikTok Shop platform, she also works with creators and pitches ideas for content.
"In general, TikTok Shop content is very to the point because the average watch time is lower," she says. "But we're working with creators to help them understand that what people watch on TikTok Shop doesn't need to be very different from what's created on TikTok. Things like make-up or hair tutorials are incredibly popular in both instances, for example, so we work together with them to make content fit seamlessly wherever it is streaming."
TikTok Shop is one of the first combination of content/discovery e-commerce ecosystems in the industry. The diverse, groundbreaking work afforded to people who uphold its operations attracted Nathan, Essig, and Shafique to the company.
"We're helping shape the discovery e-commerce landscape in this country, which is extremely nascent," says Essig. "Being able to build a marketplace from scratch is such a monumental opportunity, both for us and for the sellers and creators who use it, and will use it. We all have different roles, but share a deep passion for discovery e-commerce."
"People sometimes think TikTok Shop is a side project of TikTok, but it's growing really fast," says Shafique. One of the reasons she joined the TikTok team is due to the efficient and constant growth the platform is capable of. "I wanted to be consistently learning, and not stagnant. We get to help creators and businesses grow, which is very cool. More than any other e-commerce platform on the market today, TikTok Shop Operations is there every step of the way, from strategy to content creation to business growth."

![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/minus.1cb242dd.svg)
Interviews may vary depending on the team and the role. Our [interview tips ](https://lifeattiktok.com/interview)and how we hire might also be helpful for you.
What does the interview process include? Are there any psychometric or technical tests?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
The interview process varies depending on the team and the role. It is common for an assessment or task (usually for technical roles) to be part of the process and several rounds of interviews. Your recruiter will inform you of the specific process for the position you have applied for.
Can I change my interview schedule?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
We understand that things happen! Please let your recruiter know if you need to reschedule as soon as possible, but be aware changing you time could cause a delay in the hiring process.
What should I wear for the interview?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
We care more about your ability to perform the job than what you wear. Please feel free to wear whatever you feel comfortable in.
How do I make an accessibility request?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
Our team is dedicated to ensuring you have the accommodations you need to interview. If you need us to arrange an ASL interpreter or other accessibility aide, please ask your recruiter to connect you to the interview accommodations team. You can then confidentially discuss your accommodation options with a trained specialist.
What is the timeline for interviews?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
Most interviews take place on a rolling basis. From submitting your resume to receiving an offer, the recruiting process usually lasts one month. There are exceptions, which could mean we are sometimes a bit longer or quicker.
An employee has referred me, but I haven't heard back. What should I do?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
You can check your application status under "My applications" after logging in to our careers website. You may also contact the employee who referred you. They can check their referral status through our internal portal.
Will you inform me if I am not selected?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
We cannot respond to every applicant due to the high volume of applications. If you are already in the interview process, you will be notified that you have not been selected.
I received an email invitation to complete a survey. Does that mean I was selected for the role?
![expand-down](https://lifeattiktok.com/_next/static/media/plus.6ffb250e.svg)
We request feedback from all applicants to constantly improve our candidate experience. Receiving the candidate survey does not indicate the status of your recruitment process.

"I enjoy the impact we have on our users. The features we work on, the bugs we fix, and the issues we troubleshoot all ultimately improve the experience of more than a billion users. I also love the intellectual rigor at TikTok. "Seek Truth and Be Pragmatic" is one of the company's core values that strongly resonates with me. I truly see this value being applied in day-to-day work. We focus on learning from failures, and diving deep into root causes to make significant changes."

[#BookTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/booktok) is a passionate, powerful community that has transformed the way people discover and engage with books, reignited the publishing industry and created new opportunities for independent authors and bookstores. As World Book Day approaches on April 23 followed by Independent Bookstore Day on April 26, TikTok’s vibrant book-loving community continues its starring role in shaping the new and existing generations of readers.
The power of the community is undeniable: there are **nearly 53 million #BookTok posts on the platform** (almost an 80% increase YOY*) and in 2024 alone, **approximately 59 million print book sales could be tied to BookTok-related creators or content** **. BookTok fosters a sense of belonging and excitement around reading both on and off the platform, turning solitary book experiences into shared celebrations.
**Independent Bookstores: Hotspots for BookTok Fans**
Independent bookstores have become beloved destinations for BookTok creators, who travel across the country to explore and review their [favorite local shops](https://www.tiktok.com/@vinopapi23/video/7481777024147770670?_r=1&_t=ZT-8vOgdsGoSgY). Some even participate in [#bookcrawls](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bookcrawl), sharing their in-store adventures that encourage followers to support these small businesses while helping them build online visibility and increase foot traffic.

**Authors Finding Their Voice and Audience on TikTok**
For many new and self-published authors, TikTok has become a vital platform to connect directly with readers and grow an audience through TikTok Shop and the For You feed. This democratization of the book industry, partly thanks to TikTok, means more voices hold significant sway in what becomes popular and provides authors the opportunity to share their work globally while reaching millions of potential new fans.
> [@purposefulperformance](https://www.tiktok.com/@purposefulperformance?refer=embed "@purposefulperformance") Yesterday, my life changed. After my book signing at Barnes & Noble, something unexpected happened. A single TikTok video went viral—30 million views and over 4.1 million likes, and my account grew from 1 follower to over 208,000 in less than 24 hours. My first video has already passed 1 million views. And then the unthinkable: My book soared to the top of the Amazon bestseller lists in multiple categories. But it wasn’t the numbers that moved me to tears yesterday. It was you. I’ve received thousands of messages—so many I can’t keep up. Words of encouragement. Stories of hope. Notes from people who said the book changed their perspective… helped them become better leaders… and reminded them of the importance of bringing humanity back into the workplace. When I wrote this book, I had a straightforward hope: That it would help just one person. That someone, somewhere, might read it and realize they’re not alone. That caring, compassionate leadership isn’t soft—it’s powerful. As leaders, our responsibility isn’t just managing outcomes; it's uplifting those who make those outcomes possible. I never imagined this kind of response. And in a world that can often feel lonely, especially as a first-time author… You made me feel seen. You changed my life. And I’ll never forget it. To everyone who has read the book, left a comment, shared a kind word, or reached out with a story— Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am humbled. I am overwhelmed. I am so incredibly grateful. 💛 [#thankyou](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/thankyou?refer=embed "thankyou") [#gratitude](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gratitude?refer=embed "gratitude") [#purposefulperformance](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/purposefulperformance?refer=embed "purposefulperformance") [#viralvideo](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viralvideo?refer=embed "viralvideo") [#humanatwork](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/humanatwork?refer=embed "humanatwork") [#tiktokcommunity](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktokcommunity?refer=embed "tiktokcommunity") [♬ original sound - Jonathan Stanley](https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7485425087693359914?refer=embed "♬ original sound - Jonathan Stanley")

Ahead of the 97th Oscars® hosted by Conan O'Brien ([@teamcoco](https://www.tiktok.com/@teamcoco)), TikTok's movie-loving community takes the opportunity to look back on the past year in cinema, sharing their thoughts on everything from [nominations](https://www.tiktok.com/@cinema.joe/video/7463146566086446382?q=oscar%20nominations&t=1739287170237) to [predictions for winners](https://www.tiktok.com/@comfortfilmsss/video/7467771013107944750?q=oscar%20predictions&t=1739287215333) ahead of Hollywood's biggest night.
With over 2.6M combined posts and a **50% increase in posts in the US in 2024,** [#FilmTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/filmtok) and [#MovieTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/MovieTok) continue to grow their impact on the industry while offering movie buffs a place to share their thoughts on their passions, celebrate film, and connect around the buzziest moments in entertainment. 87% of US TikTok users report going to the movies*, solidifying the platform as a go-to destination for audiences to engage with everything related to their favorite shows and movies.
**TikTok is where fans come to engage with entertainment**
TikTok creators are driving an evolution in how and where conversations with film and TV fans are happening, reaching new communities and sharing the joy and artistry of film with their commentary. Creators like **Monse Gutierrez ([@cvnela](https://www.tiktok.com/@cvnela))** and **Zainab Jiwa ([@zeewhatidid](https://www.tiktok.com/@zeewhatidid))** have been invited to some of the world's biggest film festivals, are staples on red carpets, and have interviewed some of the most recognizable talent - all while bringing their TikTok audience with them.

Today we're announcing the test of Footnotes, a new feature that will give our community more context about content on TikTok. Footnotes will draw on the collective knowledge of the TikTok community by allowing people to add relevant information to content on our platform. To start, this feature will be tested in the U.S. for short form videos. It will add to our suite of measures that help people understand the reliability of content and access authoritative sources, including our content labels, search banners, our fact-checking program, and more.
TikTok gives over 170 million Americans the freedom to express themselves and share, resulting in an immensity of content to discover and learn from. Whether the content discusses a complex STEM-related concept, shares statistics that could misrepresent a topic, or updates about an ongoing event, there may be additional context that could help others better understand it. That's why we're building Footnotes.
![](https://p16-va-tiktok.ibyteimg.com/obj/musically-maliva-obj/81e26d7dfa9c4cdcebec8095535c68ad.jpeg)
Our comments section and other tools like Stitch and Duet already empower people to share their opinions and engage in dialogue around content. Footnotes offers a new opportunity for people to share their expertise and add an additional layer of context to the discussion using a consensus-driven approach.
**Who can add a footnote?**
Starting today, U.S. users can [apply](https://www.tiktok.com/falcon/communitysafety/page/footnotes/index.html?container_color_auto_dark=1&hide_nav_bar=1&should_full_screen=1&use_spark=1&enter_from=blog_post_link) to be a Footnotes contributor, and we'll also notify U.S. users who meet our eligibility requirements, [including](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/exploring-videos/footnotes):
  1. They have been on the platform for more than 6 months.
  2. They are 18 years old or older.
  3. They have no recent history of violating our Community Guidelines.
We'll open access to start contributing footnotes over the coming months. Once admitted, contributors can add footnotes to videos and rate those left by others.
**Publishing footnotes**
Footnotes will use a bridge-based ranking 
Footnotes augments our existing suite of platform integrity measures and features. For example, we add labels to content that can't be verified. We provide access to reliable information through TikTok's Election Centers and in Search. We also continue to partner with more than 20 IFCN-accredited fact-checking organizations to assess the accuracy of content on TikTok in over 60 languages and in 130 markets around the world. Footnotes adds to these efforts with more ways to add helpful details that may be missing, ultimately enriching discussions on TikTok and improving the experience for viewers, contributors and creators alike. We're excited to work with each group as we continue to test, get feedback, and build on the program.

Today we're announcing the launch of AMBER Alerts on TikTok with the 
Last year we piloted AMBER Alerts with our community in Texas. From August to December 2024, AMBER Alerts on TikTok were viewed over 20 million times and contributed to 2.5 million visits to NCMEC's website. Now, we're expanding these alerts to more than 170 million Americans, so when an AMBER Alert is issued, we'll show the alert in the For You feed of those within the area.
![](https://p16-va-tiktok.ibyteimg.com/obj/musically-maliva-obj/c28bf5871294cbadc427233aa8e97fea.png)
Today we're also donating advertising credits to amplify NCMEC's messaging via their official TikTok account _[@NCMEC](https://www.tiktok.com/@ncmec?lang=en)_ of missing children and youth safety information on our platform. This builds on our longstanding work to support NCMEC and our shared goal of keeping youth safe. NCMEC continues to provide vital resources about [how to protect yourself online](https://www.tiktok.com/@ncmec/video/7470176191580818719?lang=en), [back-to-school safety](https://www.tiktok.com/@ncmec/video/7409100119053815083?lang=en), advice for navigating your [teen's first smartphone](https://www.tiktok.com/@ncmec/video/7355889924266069290?lang=en), and more on their TikTok account.
We've also enlisted the help of TikTok creator, missing children advocate, and host of The Voices for Justice Podcast Sarah Turney ([@saraheturney](https://www.tiktok.com/@saraheturney?lang=en)) to help spread the word about this new effort. Sarah has dedicated her platform to advocacy for missing persons and provides guidance on how communities can take action.
The nationwide expansion of AMBER Alerts on TikTok is another example of how platforms like ours can play an active role in keeping communities informed. Whether through trusted safety resources, partnerships with leading organizations, or in-app tools that help protect users, we remain dedicated to creating a secure and supportive environment for all.
For more on TikTok’s ongoing efforts in online safety, combating child exploitation, and our ongoing partnership with NCMEC, visit our [Transparency Center](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/combating-csea).
_“Every second counts when a child goes missing. By harnessing the reach and speed of a platform like TikTok, parents, caregivers, and communities nationwide can become powerful advocates in the urgent effort to locate missing children. Building on the momentum from our successful pilot in Texas, this nationwide expansion will empower even more communities to swiftly spread critical information, amplify awareness, and help bring missing children home safely.” -_**_Gavin Portnoy, Vice President of Communications & Brand at NCMEC_**
_“Every second counts when a child goes missing, and we have to use every tool available to bring them home safely. The Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office is committed to leveraging technology and community partnerships to enhance public safety, and TikTok allows us to reach younger generations and an audience that might not otherwise see these alerts. By expanding our outreach, we’re giving families and communities another powerful way to stay informed and take action. With this expansion, agencies across the nation, including the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, will share critical information about missing children with millions of users who can help spread the word instantly." -_**_Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley_**
_"Time is crucial when a child goes missing. Using platforms like TikTok, communities can quickly spread vital information and help locate missing children. After a successful Texas pilot, this national expansion will enable more communities to raise awareness and bring missing children home quickly. Precious children are counting on us to do everything we can to rescue them." -_**_Colleen Nick, CEO of the Morgan Nick Foundation_**

With over a billion people worldwide turning to TikTok for entertainment, discovery, and creative learning, we're always exploring new ways to meet the evolving needs of our community and enhance the TikTok experience.

Now available globally, key updates include:

  * **LIVE Gaming Streaming:** Go LIVE in portrait or landscape mode, delivering a full-screen horizontal view for desktop users, while mobile users can simply rotate their devices to enjoy an equally dynamic viewing experience.

  * **New** **Collections Feature:** Organize your favorite videos into custom categories, making it easier to find and revisit saved content.

  * New Family Pairing features give parents additional tools to set boundaries and customizable limits for their individual family needs
  * A new in-app meditation feature is designed to help teens wind down if they use TikTok after 10pm
  * Since our Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Feed launched, it is now available in more than 100 countries and is enjoyed by millions of teens every week
Every day, teens around the world express their creativity, connect with friends, and learn on TikTok. We build the strongest safeguards into teen accounts by default to help ensure young people have positive experiences on our app -- and to give parents peace of mind. We see this with the success of #LearnOnTikTok which is igniting new interests in everything from local geology to ancient history. And since launching a feed dedicated to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), millions of teens use it every week. Today, we're expanding our family features to provide parents with more options for tailoring their teens' account. We're also introducing a feature to help teens build balanced digital habits.
**Simple supervision tools for families**
Since launching Family Pairing - TikTok's parenting controls - five years ago, we've continually added new features based on feedback from families, as well as guidance from leading experts. Today, we're enhancing Family Pairing by launching a way for parents to block their teens from being on TikTok during times that they control. No teen or family is the same, and whether it's during family time, school, at night, or a weekend away, caregivers can use our new **Time Away** feature to decide when it’s best for their teens to take a break. Parents can also set a reoccurring schedule to best suit their family life. If plans change, teens can request extra time, but parents make the final decision.
![](https://p16-va-tiktok.ibyteimg.com/obj/musically-maliva-obj/aada3e72ccd99ffa3b359b2afbea7a7e.gif)
We're also adding a Family Pairing feature that can allow parents to see who their teen is following on TikTok, and who follows them, along with accounts their teen has blocked. With increased visibility into their teen's network, parents will be better equipped to have ongoing conversations and help their teens develop the digital literacy skills they need.

We also hear that parents want to know more about the content their teens engage with on our app. In response, in the coming months, when a teen reports a video they think may be against TikTok's rules, they can choose to alert a parent, caregiver, or other trusted adult at the same time, even if they aren't using Family Pairing.
With these latest updates, parents can now view or adjust more than [15 safety, well-being, and privacy features](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/protecting-teens/). This includes:
  * Re-enabling our feed dedicated to STEM, if their teen has turned it off. This is now available in more than 100 countries and is enjoyed by millions of teens every week.
  * Setting customizable daily screen time limits. For example, parents could choose to limit their teens to 30 minutes on TikTok during the week but a little longer on a weekend. Once a parent-set limit has been reached, a teen can only use TikTok if their parent shares a unique passcode. Even if a parent doesn't customize their teen's settings, everyone under 18 has a 60 minute daily screen time limit by default.
  * Switching their teen's account back to the default private setting, if their teen has made it public.
**Helping teens learn balanced digital habits**
We're also announcing a new way to encourage young people to switch off at night. If a teen under 16 is on TikTok after 10pm, their For You feed will be interrupted with our new**wind down feature**. At launch, this is a full-screen takeover with calming music to help teens relax and be mindful of the time. If a teen decides to spend additional time on TikTok after the first reminder, we show a second, harder to dismiss, full-screen prompt. As before, we deliberately do not send push notifications to teens at night, which cannot be changed.
We designed these features to reflect best practices in behavioral change theory by providing positive nudges that can help teens develop balanced long-term habits. In countries where this has already been piloted, the vast majority of teens decide to keep this reminder on. In the coming weeks, we'll also test adding meditation exercises to the wind down reminder, as research shows that mindful meditation can improve sleep quality.
![](https://p16-va-tiktok.ibyteimg.com/obj/musically-maliva-obj/bc903a3980797f79bd7119153fd8d928.jpeg)
As with any new feature, we look forward to hearing feedback from our community, and to inform our future plans, we're conducting research with parents and teens around the world to understand how else we can help with the development of balanced habits.
Additionally, we've also enlisted the help of TikTok creator, mom, and child safety advocate [@danimorin13](https://www.tiktok.com/@danimorin13/video/7480555506709351710) to help raise awareness of these new features. Check out her video to hear her thoughts on both the latest updates and existing tools, including Family Pairing. 
**Partnering with industry and civil society to build consensus on age assurance**
Age assurance is one of the most complex areas that online platforms, policymakers and regulators are grappling with. We continue to enforce our age rules and add additional ways to confirm the age of people who use our platform.
We constantly work to simplify things for caregivers, so they can feel confident supporting their teens. Our [Digital Safety Partnership for Families](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-the-family-online-safety-institute-partner-to-launch-digital-safety-partnership-for-families) is designed to make it easier to start conversations about online experiences and set positive digital boundaries together. It's intentionally not specific to any single app or service and includes suggested agreements for when devices and parental supervision tools are used. Throughout 2025, we'll continue to make deliberate decisions to keep TikTok safe, especially for teens.
**Dr. Vicki Harrison, Member of TikTok's Content Advisory Counsel and Program Director for Stanford Psychiatry's Center for Youth Mental Health & Wellbeing:**
_"TikTok has responded to calls from both youth and their families for more tools that will help them support their wellbeing while using the app. Prioritizing sleep, balanced usage and more parent-teen interactions around social media use are all positive steps that I hope we see more of."_
**Stephen Balkam, CEO and Founder of the Family Online Safety Institute:**
_“TikTok’s latest iteration of its parental controls and online safety tools is a welcome development for families looking to both protect their children from harm and empower them as responsible digital citizens. Most importantly, these tools give parents greater support in fostering open, ongoing conversations about their children’s technology use."_

TikTok drives culture, brings brands into the conversation, and turns moments into momentum. At this year’s NewFronts, we're making it clear that video and culture are evolving rapidly together, and we're underscoring that our community can **watch it happening—only on TikTok.**
The TikTok community has revolutionized how moments are consumed _and_ curated. This transformation gives brands the opportunity to harness the power of real-time, always-on engagement and create lasting business impact around culture-defining content that unfolds daily on the platform.
At TikTok, we're innovating to make it easy for brands to be part of the moments on TikTok that matter most to them with a range of new solutions, including updates to the **TikTok Pulse** suite with **Pulse Core,** which makes it even easier for brands to align with the hottest trends and build cultural relevance, and with new **Pulse Premiere partners – Formula 1, Red Bull Media House, and Warner Bros Discovery.** We're also introducing new on-and-off platform **Sponsorship Solutions** which include**Content Sponsorship Packages with a range of new partners that put advertisers at the heart of cultural moments that matter most to them.**
“TikTok has become part of people’s everyday lives—it’s where they go to be educated, entertained, and to discover something new. When brands show up with that same mindset, not just to advertise but to genuinely engage, they naturally become part of the conversation. The real value comes from showing up consistently—not just during big cultural moments, but all the time—because culture doesn’t take a day off. It happens on TikTok every single day.” – **Khartoon Weiss, Vice President, Global Business Solutions at TikTok**
“TikTok is an indispensable partner that is driving real business impact for brands. We are continuing to invest and develop our TikTok product suite to help advertisers meet their audiences in the moments that matter most — driving deeper impact across awareness, consideration, and outcomes.” – **David Kaufman, Global Head of Product Operations and Solutions at TikTok**
**Seize the Moment with TikTok Pulse**
To help brands stay on the pulse of the most culturally impactful moments and content on TikTok, we created**[TikTok Pulse](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-pulse-is-bringing-brands-closer-to-community-and-entertainment), **a first-to-market suite of products that drives cultural relevance for brands by giving them the ability to have their content show up next to the hottest, trending, and most-premium brand safe content. The Pulse suite puts advertisers where they need to be on the TikTok For You feed and, according to a recent iSpot meta analysis, in a typical Pulse campaign, 45% of the audience reached hadn’t seen the ad on TV — highlighting the strong and consistent unique reach Pulse delivers. (1)
![](https://p16-va-tiktok.ibyteimg.com/obj/musically-maliva-obj/fe783751b51c4fc9a6b1f6ddadc1d8a7.gif)
Today, the TikTok Pulse suite is offering more ways to do this with **Pulse Core** and **[Pulse Premiere](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/newfronts-24-introducing-new-premium-ad-solutions-for-marketers).**
  * **Pulse Core** allows advertisers to maximize realtime community conversation that happens only on TikTok by placing them next to the top user generated content by category, holiday, or even custom-built content that works for their brand. On average, Pulse Core campaigns are **100+ times more likely** to appear next to trending topics than other campaign types during the same time period.(2)
    * **Custom Lineups:** leverages the power of generative AI to offer advertisers the best content related to a completely bespoke category or line up built just for the brand
    * **Max Pulse:** places a brand's ads next to the top 4% of content on TikTok across all content categories for maximum available reach
    * **Category Lineups:** places ads next to the best content related to a topic or genre like Sports or Beauty
    * **Seasonal Lineups:** focuses on the best content related to a cultural moment like Mother's Day or Back to School
  * **Pulse Premiere** offers advertisers exclusive placement alongside official content from premium publishers during major tentpole events and cultural moments, and also alongside always-on evergreen content from publishers across sports, entertainment, and lifestyle categories. This year we are expanding our Premiere roster by adding **Formula 1, Red Bull Media House and Warner Bros Discovery** to our suite of existing publisher partners, which includes BuzzFeed, Condé Nast, Disney, DotDash Meredith, Hearst, MLS, NBCUniversal, NFL, NHL, Paramount, and Vox.
“TikTok is one of the fastest growing platforms for Formula 1 and is part of the reason we are seeing phenomenal growth among younger audiences around the world. I am delighted that we are expanding our relationship with them as a Pulse Premiere partner to continue this growth.”**- Jonny Haworth, Director of Commercial Partnerships at Formula 1**

**Tapping into Cultural Moments**
To equip advertisers with tools to engage audiences before, during, and after moments that matter most to them, we're introducing new **Sponsorship Solutions** that offer new ways for brands to impactfully show up on and off TikTok during tentpole moments and cultural milestones. Brands can now create tailored experiences on TikTok around specific searches, hand-picking the content, interactive features, and storytelling that users will see when they look up certain keywords.
  * We are also including new **Content Sponsorship Packages** that put advertisers at the heart of cultural moments with **Live Nation's The Submix, Beauty Month: Game Face, Las Vegas Grand Prix, and more.**
    * **Live Nation's The Submix:** Launching on TikTok, the Submix is Live Nation’s new content channel built to bring fans even closer to the live music they love — with behind-the-scenes footage, on-the-road moments, and real-time tour content, hosted on TikTok. Launching this June, the Submix will kick off on TikTok’s cutting-edge Sponsorship Solutions to let fans take action in the moment — from buying tickets and shopping merch to exploring artist playlists — while giving brands dynamic new ways to connect with fans around what matters most: live music.
    * **TikTok Beauty Month: Game Face** is an evolution of TikTok Beauty Month reimagined through the world of women in sports, from athletes and trainers to commentators and creators who are all reshaping what beauty means both on-and-off the field. This high impact package puts brands at the intersection of strength, self-expression, and cultural relevance with a mixture of on platform activations, Out of Phone content, and IRL creator celebrations and conversations.
    * **Las Vegas Grand Prix:** Working with several partners, TikTok is taking over the Las Vegas Strip for race day with an all-access, immersive weekend that puts brands at the forefront of the action. TikTok’s immersive, creator-driven ecosystem allows brands to show up in ways that feel native, exciting, and highly shareable with a mix of onsite brand activations and Out of Phone screens as well as on-platform branded moments supported by adjacency to official race day content with Formula 1's Pulse Premiere Lineup.
TikTok isn’t just where people discover what’s happening – it’s the place where they experience and engage with moments more than any other platform. New research in partnership with EyeSee revealed TikTok is the **#1** **place** where users **become informed about upcoming moments** , with **2 in 3 users** saying TikTok is where they usually get informed about upcoming moments. (3) And when it comes to shopping for moments, TikTok is a top source of discovery, with **25% of users** stating TikTok was their first choice in searching for what to buy for an upcoming moment. (4)

Today, Oxford Economics published a new report measuring the number of jobs benefited by TikTok. Over the last seven years, TikTok has become an indispensable platform for businesses all across the country, with **7.5 million businesses on the platform employing more than** **28 million workers.**
Specifically, Oxford Economics found that **4.7 million US jobs benefit from utilizing TikTok**. This includes:
  * More than **3.1 million jobs directly using TikTok** in their work either by creating content for the platform or managing their accounts
  * Over **1.6 million workers indirectly benefiting** from TikTok in areas like **lead generation** for sales teams, **customer engagement** for marketing, or product teams **examining user feedback** on the platform.
![](https://p16-va-tiktok.ibyteimg.com/obj/musically-maliva-obj/1dbdb2fd48aa23d70b0d183bbfbf3a16.jpeg)
The report also studied how TikTok’s unique features enable businesses to create authentic and engaging content that enables them to build wealth on their own terms. **Almost three-quarters (74%) of businesses reported that TikTok allowed them to scale their operations** , a fact that was true for both small and large businesses.
“TikTok’s impact on the US economy continues to expand, with millions of small and mid-sized businesses using the platform to reach new customers, increase engagement, and create jobs,” said **Blake Chandlee** , **President of Global Business Solutions at TikTok**. “The latest Oxford Economics report underscores this growing influence, estimating that 28 million people are employed by businesses that leverage TikTok’s features. The platform isn’t just a tool for brand awareness—it’s a catalyst for real economic opportunity, fueling job growth and innovation across the country."
According to **Laurence Wilse-Samson, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics** , “the survey findings and an analysis of TikTok's business account data suggest that millions of people in US businesses are either directly using the app as part of their jobs or benefit from the leads and opportunities it creates.”
This newest report from Oxford builds upon a _fully supported_ by SMB’s activity on TikTok. In this new Oxford report, the analysis focused on the total number of people using - or benefiting from - the platform in a job context, resulting in an estimated 4.7 million jobs.
Oxford Economics conducted a 1,000-respondent survey to better understand how U.S. businesses and workers engage with and benefit from TikTok in the United States, including all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The survey was fielded from December 2024 through January 2025. To participate in the survey, businesses had to have a TikTok account for business use. The findings are also based on TikTok's proprietary business account data and business population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.
For small business owners like Vanessa Barreat, TikTok has been transformational.
“We started in September 2016 with nothing but a small food stand in a local flea market—just me, my husband, and two employees,” said**Vanessa Barreat, owner of[La Vecindad](https://www.tiktok.com/@lavecindadlv) **in Las Vegas, Nevada. “Today, we have 60 employees, two locations, and a thriving community of customers who found us through TikTok. Dozens of families now rely on La Vecindad, and we can even send our children to college—something we once only dreamed of.”
That impact extends to businesses of all sizes and industries.
"TikTok was one of the major factors that helped us triple our business," said **Alex Bellman, chief operating officer of[Bellman Jewelers](https://www.tiktok.com/@thetruthfuljeweler)** in Manchester, New Hampshire. "Because of TikTok, we had to hire eight new employees and are now opening a second location in Boston. Without this platform, we’d have to spend tens of thousands of dollars just to try to compete with larger brands. It’s helped level the playing field for small businesses like ours."
TikTok’s economic reach goes even further. Not included in the analysis are the impacts of millions of other users generating content, many of whom may not have a business account, but who use the platform to support their personal brands, generate income, and build careers—whether through independent artistry, entrepreneurship, or content monetization. TikTok continues to be a driving force for economic empowerment, providing opportunities for businesses and individuals alike to thrive in the digital economy.

Today, TikTok is celebrating the magic of math and marking the two-year anniversary of our STEM feed. From favorite teachers inspiring students beyond the classroom to communities exploring the wonders of the world together, our STEM feed connects users with engineers, scientists, astronomers, and more. It’s a space where curiosity thrives and learning has no limits, bringing together diverse creators and experts to share discoveries, insights, and a passion for STEM—making science, technology, engineering, and math more accessible and engaging for everyone.
As part of our Pi Day celebrations on March 13, (3.14), we’re showcasing creative ways to incorporate STEM and learning into family activities. Honoring π (Pi), the never-ending mathematical number that helps measure circles, we’re highlighting how it appears in everyday life through hands-on DIY projects, baking delicious recipes inspired by its digits, and more—turning Pi Day into an interactive and memorable experience for all ages.
**Creator Spotlight**
We’ve teamed up with four beloved TikTok creators who are sharing engaging Pi-themed activities that inspire curiosity and creativity:
  * **Shannon Doherty (_[@athomewithshannon](https://www.tiktok.com/@athomewithshannon?lang=en)_): **A mom of four and business owner known for her viral ‘mom hacks’ and DIY crafts, Shannon created fun, family-friendly Pi Day activities to celebrate the day. Check it out below for some great ideas!
  * **Benjamin Delwiche ([@benjaminthebaker](https://www.tiktok.com/@benjaminthebaker?lang=en)):** A baker and math teacher, Benjamin uses ratios, percentages, and precision to reveal the science behind baking. His content makes complex techniques fun and approachable for all bakers. Explore his unique approach here!
  * **Gohar Khan (_[@goharsguide](https://www.tiktok.com/@goharsguide)_): **An MIT grad with a dedicated following for his study tips, college application advice, and life hacks, Gohar provided engaging math insights and helpful tips on how to memorize Pi. Dive into his content below to discover more.
  * **Robert Lucas (_[@thesweetimpact](https://www.tiktok.com/@thesweetimpact?lang=en)_): **A self-taught cake artist and baker renowned for his intricate designs and pop culture-inspired creations, Robert showcased the role of math in baking and shared tips on decorating pies for Pi Day. See his stunning work here!

This was a really cool design to bring to fruition and also included a little math and measuring to make it happen. Check out the STEM feed for more discovery and learning.

**Two Years of the STEM feed: Expanding access to learning**
TikTok's STEM feed, [originally launched](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/take-discovery-to-a-new-level-with-stem-feed) on Pi Day 2023, is now [on by default for all US users](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-stem-feed-now-available-to-all-users-by-default), offering high-quality educational content for teens and the whole family to enjoy. Today, nearly one in three US teens visit the STEM feed weekly, with 10 million STEM-related videos published globally in the past three years—sparking curiosity and enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering, and math on TikTok.
**Join the celebration**
Whether you're a teacher, parent, scientist, or STEM enthusiast, join the fun by publishing your own STEM content and tagging #STEMtok for a chance to be featured on the STEM feed. Stay tuned for more Pi Day fun, and be sure to follow _[@athomewithshannon](https://www.tiktok.com/@athomewithshannon?lang=en)_ ,_[@benjaminthebaker](https://www.tiktok.com/@benjaminthebaker?lang=en),_ _[@goharsguide](https://www.tiktok.com/@goharsguide)_ and _[@thesweetimpact](https://www.tiktok.com/@thesweetimpact?lang=en)_ as they share their Pi Day-inspired content.

TikTok and Major League Soccer (MLS) are excited to announce the renewal of their strategic partnership with an extended multiyear agreement. This renewed collaboration reinforces our ongoing commitment to enriching the soccer fan experience, providing fans with unparalleled access to the sport, and strengthening the connection between MLS, its players, and the global fan community.
Since [kicking off the partnership](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-mls-enter-multi-year-partnership-to-bring-soccer-fans-closer-to-the-action) in 2023, TikTok has become a go-to platform for soccer fans, offering everything from behind-the-scenes content to live match highlights, fan reactions, and creative edits. This extension builds on the success of initiatives like last year's groundbreaking [Player Spotlight: Messi](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/mls-season-pass-on-apple-tv-major-league-soccer-present-player-spotlight-messi-exclusively-tiktok), where TikTok, in partnership with Apple TV and MLS, exclusively streamed a live feed of Lionel Messi during his debut MLS Cup Playoff match for Inter Miami CF. This marked the first time TikTok streamed an entire live soccer match with a single player focus and was the largest live viewership for a U.S. sports league on the platform.
"We are excited to renew our partnership with Major League Soccer and continue bringing fans closer to the sport they love," said **Rollo Goldstaub, Head of Sports Partnerships, TikTok.** "MLS has one of the most passionate and engaged fanbases in the world, and we look forward to offering even more unique and exciting opportunities for fans to connect in ways that only TikTok can offer."
Millions of soccer fans are already thriving on TikTok: there are 14.8 million posts using [#soccer](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/soccer), with **nearly 9 million posts in 2024** alone. MLS' growing international presence on TikTok, with 65% of its fanbase outside the US (TikTok internal data, 2024) reflects the league's global appeal and engagement with fans around the world.
"Major League Soccer’s continued partnership with TikTok supports our commitment to reaching fans with dynamic content, driving global engagement and discovery,” said **Jen Cramer, Executive Vice President of Partnership Marketing, Major League Soccer.** “This collaboration helps us engage soccer enthusiasts while also evolving how we connect with the next generation of MLS fans and new audiences."
This renewed partnership continues to keep TikTok at the heart of global soccer fandom, bringing fans exclusive access, creative content, and one-of-a-kind experiences that celebrate the game we all love.

With a shared vision to elevate the skilled trades and meet the growing demand for skilled talent, Skilled Careers Coalition (SCC) and SkillsUSA today announced a strategic partnership with TikTok. The partnership will leverage Skilled Career Coalition’s growing for youth, by youth platform, SKILLS JAM, which has helped amplify the excitement of skilled careers through entertaining short- and long-form content, and a growing wave of skilled trade creators on TikTok, who tell the behind-the-scenes stories of their work, share tips, and help educate others about their professions. 
The collaboration, which underscores how TikTok is becoming the go-to destination for career exploration and inspiration, highlights how creators can influence students' interest in trade schools, apprenticeships, and high-demand CTE careers. 
Said **Mark Hedstrom, Executive Director, Skilled Careers Coalition** , “The skilled trades are the backbone of America’s economic engine, but the widening skilled labor gap is threatening entire industries, including booming sectors like manufacturing, construction, robotics and others. From high schoolers to those in career transition, by working together with key partners such as TikTok, we can move further faster to rebuild the great American workforce and meet the demand for skilled talent today and long-term.” 
Said **Michael Beckerman, Vice President and Head of Americas Public Policy, TikTok** , “Every day, we see incredible creators on TikTok showcasing what life is really like in the trades—from welding tips to day-in-the-life content that inspires career changes and sparks curiosity. This partnership will help bring greater visibility to those stories, while also qualifying some of this content for TikTok’s STEM feed—broadening its reach and impact even further. By shining a spotlight on skilled trades, we’re not only celebrating this essential work, but also helping to drive interest and create new job opportunities in industries that need talent.” 
Together, SCC and TikTok will be producing unique content that brings young people and TikTok skilled trade creators together as part of a series of local market workforce development events to be scheduled across the country, including at SkillsUSA’s annual National Leadership & Skills Conference in Atlanta June 23-27, 2025. With more than 6,000 students competing across more than 100 skilled categories, the conference is the largest, longest-running gathering of aspiring skilled trades professionals in the U.S. 
“SkillsUSA students have the personal, workplace and technical skills that employers are looking for,” said **Chelle Travis, Executive Director of SkillsUSA**. “We truly bridge the gap between education and industry ensuring the next generation of skilled professionals and leaders are career ready. Our partnership with SCC and TikTok opens new doors for students and is a testament to the power of collaboration.” 
According to  TikTok creators— especially small business owners— are offering a raw, unfiltered look into life in the trades, spotlighting everything from income potential to creative independence. The platform has become a powerful influence on Gen Z’s career choices. 
Added **SCC’s Hedstrom** , “Skilled careers are fulfilling, high-paying, always-in-demand, and provide a fast, low-cost path to lifelong success. Through strategic partnerships with TikTok, SkillsUSA and others, Skilled Careers Coalition is building a skilled trade recruitment engine while helping to raise awareness about the endless possibilities, financial success, entrepreneurial control, and career satisfaction that a skilled career offers.” 
**About SkillsUSA** SkillsUSA is the #1 workforce development organization for students, empowering them to become skilled professionals, career-ready leaders and responsible community members. SkillsUSA represents more than 442,000 career and technical education students and teachers in middle schools, high schools and college/postsecondary institutions nationwide.
